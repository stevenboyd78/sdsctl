`sdsctl` is an alpha Python library and command-line toolkit for the
Uniden SDS100, SDS150, and SDS200 scanners. It provides the model-neutral
`sdsctl` command, a typed Python API, USB serial control for all supported
models, and native Ethernet control and RTSP/RTP audio for the SDS200.

The project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Uniden.

## Supported scanners

| Model | USB control | Native Ethernet control | RTSP/RTP audio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SDS100 | Yes | No | No |
| SDS150 | Yes | No | No |
| SDS200 | Yes | Yes | Yes |

SDS200 USB, Ethernet control, and network audio have been validated on physical
hardware. SDS100 core USB behavior has also been hardware-validated. SDS150
support is specification-backed and awaits physical-hardware validation. See
the canonical
[supported-models guide](https://github.com/stevenboyd78/sdsctl/blob/main/docs/supported-models.md)
for exact validation scope and tested firmware.

## Common tasks

### Find scanners

```bash
sdsctl discover
sdsctl discover --network 192.168.0.0/24 --network-only
```

Only probe networks you own or are authorized to scan.

### Show scanner information

```bash
sdsctl info
sdsctl --host SCANNER_IP info
```

### Start monitoring

```bash
sdsctl monitor
sdsctl --host SCANNER_IP monitor
sdsctl --host SCANNER_IP tui
```

### Play or record SDS200 network audio

```bash
sdsctl --host SCANNER_IP audio --play

sdsctl --host SCANNER_IP audio \
  --output scanner-audio.wav \
  --duration 30
```

### Run the daemon-backed web dashboard

Install the web extra, start the daemon, then start the loopback web service in
another terminal:

```bash
python -m pip install "sds200[web]"
sdsctl --log-level INFO --host SCANNER_IP daemon
sdsctl web
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` on the same host. The dashboard consumes daemon
state and services; it does not open a second scanner control or RTSP/RTP audio
connection. Current browser workflows include ordered live updates, explicit
audio playback, daemon-owned recording, and safe playback/download of finalized
recordings.

See the visual [Web dashboard](Web-Dashboard) page for the workspace and theme
gallery, and the canonical
[web dashboard guide](https://github.com/stevenboyd78/sdsctl/blob/main/docs/web-dashboard.md)
for security boundaries and exact behavior.

### Install the Home Assistant App

On Home Assistant OS, add
`https://github.com/stevenboyd78/sdsctl` under
**Settings > Apps > App store > Repositories**, then install **sds200**.

The published App uses Home Assistant Ingress for its dashboard, obtains the
configured MQTT service from Supervisor, stores recordings in writable Home
Assistant media storage, and publishes UDP `50000` for SDS200 RTP audio. The
default recording library is `/media/sdsctl/recordings`; the media-relative
`recording_directory` option can select another location below `/media`.

Home Assistant MQTT Discovery exposes seventeen state/diagnostic components,
including fixed Screen Kind and optional Site, Frequency, Modulation, Service
Type, and configured Tone-Out Tone A and Tone B sensors, plus seven bounded
scanner controls: System, Department, Site, and Channel Hold
switches and Previous Channel, Next Channel, and Reconnect Scanner buttons. The
App keeps the generic daemon MQTT request-envelope command input disabled.

The App installs three first-party Lovelace cards plus one aggregate resource.
For a new installation, register
`/local/sds200/sds200-cards.js?v=543b8d2fa1d257c64ee343f5880f330a18bc4e254ad8d11523450e296b5322a1`
once under **Settings > Dashboards > Resources** as a JavaScript Module. It
loads **SDS200 Scanner**, **SDS200 Display**, and **SDS200 Waterfall** through
their exact digest-qualified modules. The three individual complete URLs remain
supported for selective registration and existing installations. The display
card provides five explicit scanner-style layouts plus an
opt-in Auto layout, three palettes, and a viewport-bounded 4:3 fit. Auto uses
Screen Kind with a configurable Simple or Detail scanning fallback.
The waterfall card uses authenticated App Ingress for the daemon's relative,
uncalibrated spectrum stream, with bounded responsive Canvas history and no
entity, URL, credential, or scanner-address configuration. Scanner controls
remain standard Home Assistant entities rather than a transport inside a card.

Deterministic fictional-data reference captures are available for

[800×480 wall panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenboyd78/sdsctl/main/docs/assets/home-assistant/home-assistant-waterfall-800x480.png),
and [390×844 phone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenboyd78/sdsctl/main/docs/assets/home-assistant/home-assistant-waterfall-390x844-dpr2.png)
presentations. The captures contain no private Home Assistant or scanner data.

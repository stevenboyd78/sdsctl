# sds200

The sds200 Home Assistant App runs the existing single-owner SDS200 daemon and
web dashboard under Home Assistant Supervisor.

For a published release, add
`https://github.com/stevenboyd78/sdsctl` as a third-party repository from
**Settings > Apps > App store > Repositories**, then install **sds200** from that
repository. Local `/addons` staging is intended only for development.

It provides:

- the full scanner dashboard through authenticated Home Assistant Ingress;
- live scanner status and semantic scanner controls;
- browser audio from the daemon-owned SDS200 RTP stream;
- daemon-owned recordings stored in Home Assistant media, defaulting to
  `/media/sdsctl/recordings`;
- automatic use of the Supervisor-provided MQTT service;
- Home Assistant MQTT Discovery with seventeen state/diagnostic entities,
  including fixed Screen Kind and optional Site, Frequency, Modulation, Service
  Type, and configured Tone-Out Tone A and Tone B sensors, plus
  seven bounded scanner-control entities: four Hold switches and Previous
  Channel, Next Channel, and Reconnect Scanner buttons; and
- three optional read-only Lovelace presentations: the compact SDS200 Scanner
  card; a responsive 4:3 SDS200 Display card with five explicit layouts, opt-in
  automatic layout selection, and three palettes; and an authenticated
  responsive SDS200 Waterfall card with bounded relative spectrum history.

The App requires a LAN-connected SDS200 and publishes UDP port `50000` for the
scanner's inbound RTP audio. It does not enable host networking or expose the
daemon's private Unix-domain client sockets.

See the App Documentation tab for configuration, networking, storage, security,
and troubleshooting details.

# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add fixed read-only configured Tone-Out Tone A and Tone B MQTT Discovery
  sensors plus matching optional selectors in both bundled Lovelace cards.
  Numeric zero tones render as `Detect` while preserving raw entity state.
- Add the separately registered `/local/sds200/sds200-display-card.js` resource
  with five scanner-style layouts, three palettes, a viewport-bounded 4:3 mode,
  and a graphical editor compatible with existing fourteen-entity configurations.
- Add fixed read-only Site, Frequency, Modulation, and Service Type MQTT
  Discovery sensors plus matching optional bundled Lovelace card selectors.
  Existing entity identities and controls remain unchanged, and a nullable
  mode-dependent sensor becomes unavailable when its current field is absent.

## 0.21.0

- Track the sdsctl v0.21.0 release while preserving the compatibility-sensitive
  Home Assistant App name, slug, image identity, and Python distribution name
  as `sds200`.
- Repository and documentation links use the canonical
  `stevenboyd78/sdsctl` project identity. The existing Home Assistant MQTT
  Discovery, scanner-control, Ingress, audio, and recording ownership model
  remains unchanged by release preparation.

## 0.20.2

- Home Assistant MQTT Discovery now includes seven bounded scanner-control
  entities alongside the existing ten state/diagnostic entities: System,
  Department, Site, and Channel Hold switches plus Previous Channel, Next
  Channel, and Reconnect Scanner buttons. The App keeps generic daemon MQTT
  commands disabled; dedicated QoS 0 non-retained control topics translate into
  fresh internal typed daemon requests and preserve the daemon as sole scanner
  owner.
- The App now installs a bundled read-only SDS200 Lovelace card under Home
  Assistant `www`, available as `/local/sds200/sds200-card.js`; users register
  the module once through the normal Home Assistant dashboard Resources page,
  then configure the card through Home Assistant's built-in graphical entity
  selectors.
- Configuration fields now have user-facing names and descriptions, including
  explicit guidance that `recording_directory` is relative to Home Assistant
  `/media` and that the default resolves to `/media/sdsctl/recordings`.

## 0.20.1

- Recordings now use writable Home Assistant media storage, defaulting to
  `/media/sdsctl/recordings`, with a configurable media-relative
  `recording_directory`.
- Existing v0.20.0 files under `/data/recordings`, including metadata sidecars
  and nested library paths, migrate safely without overwriting destination
  conflicts.
- The dashboard groups daemon runtime with scanner connection, moves scanner
  reconnect into that panel, separates active capture from recent recordings,
  and gives the finalized library more vertical room.
- The Home Assistant sidebar panel requests the `mdi:radio-tower` icon.

## 0.20.0

- Project-consistent Home Assistant App icon and logo presentation assets.
- Initial Home Assistant App packaging for the existing SDS200 daemon and web
  dashboard.
- Supervisor MQTT service adaptation with ten read-only MQTT Discovery entities.
- Authenticated Ingress dashboard with live scanner state, controls, browser
  audio, recording, and saved-recording playback.
- Persistent recordings under `/data/recordings`.
- Fixed UDP `50000` publication for inbound SDS200 RTP without host networking.
- amd64 and aarch64 image build/publishing workflow.

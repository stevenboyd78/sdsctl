# Semantic presentation model

Version 0.12 development introduces a renderer-independent presentation layer
between scanner state and user interfaces. The module contains no Rich, Textual,
ANSI-color, or terminal dependencies.

`present_radio_state()` converts a `RadioStateSnapshot` into an immutable
`ScannerPresentation`. The result describes meaning rather than appearance:

- connection: unknown, connected, degraded, or disconnected
- activity: unknown, idle, scanning, receiving, or holding
- signal: unknown, none, weak, fair, good, or strong
- hold: unknown, none, or active
- availability: unknown, available, stale, or unavailable
- severity: normal, informational, warning, or error
- normalized mute, recording, service-type, and raw-signal values

The SDS scanner signal scale is grouped into stable semantic bands: zero or less
is none, one is weak, two is fair, three is good, and four or greater is strong.
Renderers may map those bands to text, symbols, colors, or other accessible cues.
They must not infer domain meaning from a specific color.

```python
from sds200 import RadioStateSnapshot, present_radio_state

snapshot = RadioStateSnapshot(
    mode="Trunk Scan",
    signal=5,
    mute="Unmute",
    service_type="Interop",
)
presentation = present_radio_state(snapshot, connected=True)

assert presentation.activity == "receiving"
assert presentation.signal == "strong"
assert presentation.as_dict()["severity"] == "normal"
```

Freshness is explicit. Callers set `stale=True` when their own age threshold is
exceeded; the presentation layer does not contain a clock or impose a polling
policy. Likewise, `degraded=True` represents transport or health information
provided by the caller without coupling this module to a particular transport.

## Theme roles and palettes

`theme_roles_for()` converts a `ScannerPresentation` into stable `ThemeRole`
values such as `connection.connected`, `activity.receiving`, `signal.strong`,
and `severity.warning`. This selection still describes meaning; it does not
return Rich styles, Textual CSS, ANSI escape sequences, or terminal objects.

`ThemePalette` maps every semantic role to an immutable `ThemeStyle`. Styles use
renderer-neutral foreground and background strings plus bold, dim, and underline
flags. The built-in `DEFAULT_DARK_THEME` and `DEFAULT_LIGHT_THEME` provide
complete starting palettes. Renderers translate these generic values into their
own style systems.

Those two compatibility objects are loaded from validated built-in packages at
`sds200/themes/tui/dark/` and `sds200/themes/tui/light/`. Each package contains a
versioned manifest, a complete declarative `palette.json`, and theme-only
Textual CSS. One immutable registry validates every semantic role and produces
the exact singleton objects shared by Rich CLI and Textual; shared TUI layout
remains outside the packages. Milestone 26.12 does not scan user-writable
directories or add theme-selection values.

```python
from sds200 import (
    DEFAULT_DARK_THEME,
    RadioStateSnapshot,
    present_radio_state,
    theme_roles_for,
)

presentation = present_radio_state(
    RadioStateSnapshot(mode="Trunk Scan", signal=5, mute="Unmute"),
    connected=True,
)
roles = theme_roles_for(presentation)
style = DEFAULT_DARK_THEME.resolve(roles.signal)

assert roles.signal == "signal.strong"
assert style.foreground == "#5fd75f"
assert style.bold is True
```

Color is supplementary. CLI and TUI adapters must continue to expose labels,
symbols, ordering, or other non-color cues so connection, warning, hold, mute,
and recording states remain understandable when color is disabled or unavailable.

## Rich CLI adapter

The human-readable `scanner-info` command uses a narrow Rich adapter that converts
`ThemeStyle` values into Rich `Style` objects. The adapter derives activity, signal,
mute, and recording roles from `ScannerPresentation`; it does not infer meaning from
colors inside the CLI.

Rich performs terminal capability detection. Interactive terminals receive semantic
styles, while redirected output, test captures, and pipelines retain the same
line-oriented plain-text layout used before the adapter. Structured JSON output paths
remain independent from Rich and continue to serialize domain data only.

## CLI color and theme controls

Global CLI options make color behavior explicit without changing the semantic
content of the output:

```text
sdsctl --theme dark --color auto scanner-info
sdsctl --theme light --color always scanner-info
sdsctl --no-color scanner-info
```

`--color` accepts `auto`, `always`, or `never`; `--no-color` is an alias for
`--color never`. Explicit `always` and `never` choices take priority over
environment variables. With `--color auto`, the presence of `NO_COLOR` disables ANSI styling,
`FORCE_COLOR` enables it, and `FORCE_COLOR=0` disables it. If neither variable is
present, Rich performs normal terminal detection. When both variables are present,
`NO_COLOR` takes priority.

`--theme` accepts `dark` or `light`. Palette selection changes styling only. Labels,
field values, ordering, and line structure remain identical with either palette and
with color disabled, so scanner state is never communicated by color alone.

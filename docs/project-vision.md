# Project Vision

This document preserves the broader direction of the `sdsctl` project and
user-facing tool. It records architectural decisions, safety and
security constraints, deferred capabilities, and product ideas that are not yet
ready for a scheduled milestone.

For ordered implementation work, see [the roadmap](../ROADMAP.md).

## Purpose

The project is intended to provide one reliable, model-neutral platform for
controlling, observing, recording, and integrating supported Uniden SDS-series
scanners.

The same typed protocol, immutable state, lifecycle services, and semantic
presentation layers should support:

- the Python API;
- the `sdsctl` command-line interface;
- the Textual terminal interface;
- future daemon and web interfaces;
- Home Assistant and other local integrations;
- possible future desktop interfaces.

Interfaces should consume shared services rather than independently implementing
scanner protocols or opening competing scanner sessions.

## Naming and compatibility

`SDSScanner` and `sdsctl` are the preferred model-neutral user-facing names.

Layered application configuration now uses the `sdsctl` namespace. Future
services, state, cache, daemon, and integration names should use the same
namespace:

- system configuration: `/etc/sdsctl/`;
- user configuration: `~/.config/sdsctl/`;
- persistent user state: `~/.local/state/sdsctl/`;
- user cache: `~/.cache/sdsctl/`;
- service naming: forms such as `sdsctl.service`.

The product, repository, and executable are named `sdsctl`; the canonical
repository is `https://github.com/stevenboyd78/sdsctl`. The existing Python
distribution and import package remain named `sds200`, and the source package
remains `src/sds200`. Home Assistant and other compatibility identifiers retain
their existing `sds200` names where Milestone 25.3 explicitly requires them.

Legacy `sds200` configuration must not be silently abandoned. Milestone 19.1
adds read-only detection of known legacy profile locations while preserving their
existing defaults. It does not move or rewrite user data; any future migration
requires an explicit compatibility plan.

## Post-v1.0 scanner-family expansion

Broader Uniden scanner-family compatibility is an unscheduled post-v1.0 product
direction. Pre-v1.0 work should finish and stabilize the SDS100, SDS150, and
SDS200 experience rather than expand the hardware matrix. A model listed here is
not supported until its behavior appears in a released changelog with explicit
capabilities, regression coverage, documentation, and representative physical
validation.

The BCD436HP and BCD536HP are the leading research candidates. Uniden's SDS
Series Remote Command Specification V2.00 states that it was created from the
[BCDx36HP Remote Command Specification V1.05][bcdx36hp-remote], and the families
share a substantial command and XML scanner-state foundation. Future work may
reuse model-neutral state, presentation, Favorites Workspace, recording, and
interface services, but must not infer support for SDS-only commands or fields.
BCD536HP Wi-Fi control and audio require their own reviewed transport rather than
being treated as SDS200 native UDP behavior.

Later candidates may include HomePatrol models with the required control
capabilities, the BCD325P2/BCD996P2 DMA family, BCD160DN/BCD260DN conventional
digital models, BC125AT-class conventional scanners, and older documented XT/T
families. Each distinct family requires evidence-led protocol comparison and a
separate assessment of transport, command framing, state projection, memory
hierarchy, programming storage, audio, firmware limits, licensing, and physical
hardware availability. Compatibility with unrelated Uniden product categories
is outside this direction.

Any expansion should preserve explicit model capabilities and fail-closed model
detection. Protocol, transport, storage, audio, and presentation adapters should
remain separable so that a new scanner family can feed shared interfaces without
weakening SDS behavior or opening competing scanner sessions. Favorites editing
or scanner writes require a representative private-data-free corpus, lossless
round-trip evidence, model-specific backup and restore acceptance, and physical
validation before write support is advertised.

## Architectural principles

### Model-neutral domain services

Scanner protocol parsing, state, presentation, recording metadata, audio fanout,
and remote destinations should remain independent of a particular renderer.

Raw scanner values should be preserved even when a semantic classifier provides a
normalized interpretation. Unknown commands, nodes, modes, and fields should fail
safely or remain available for future support.

### Control and audio isolation

Scanner control and network audio are separate subsystems.

An audio startup, codec, sink, encoder, playback-device, recording, or remote
destination failure must not close, replace, or interrupt the active scanner
control transport.

One decoded audio stream should fan out to independent destinations. Slow disk,
device, encoder, or network operations must not block RTP reception.

### Single-owner daemon direction

Milestone 19.3 provides the renderer-neutral ownership runtime for long-lived
scanner control, PSI, one audio fanout, and dynamic decoded-PCM destinations.
Milestones 19.4 through 19.7 host that runtime in `sdsctl daemon` and add private
versioned API, ordered-event, and accepted-PCMU services. Milestone 19.8 adds
typed bounded scanner controls. Milestones 19.9 and 19.10 add explicit
daemon-backed CLI and TUI clients. Milestone 20.1 begins the loopback web client,
and Milestones 20.2 through 20.5 add the responsive dashboard, ordered live
updates, explicit PCMU playback, and daemon-owned recording workflows including
a fourth private finalized-recording service.

The SDS200 accepts only one network-audio client at a time. The ownership runtime
holds that single RTSP/RTP session, publishes each accepted PCMU packet once, and
decodes it once. The shared decoded-PCM router already fans that decode out to
daemon-owned destinations and browser recording without opening another scanner
audio session. Independent decoded-PCM client subscriptions may be added later;
a slow or failed subscriber must never block RTP reception or another subscriber.

The web dashboard and explicit daemon-backed CLI and TUI modes consume local
daemon services instead of opening duplicate scanner connections. Standalone CLI
and TUI operation remains available where practical. Future automation clients,
including Home Assistant, should follow the same single-owner boundary.

### Deterministic lifecycle behavior

Startup, reconnect, cancellation, teardown, and partial failure paths are first
class behavior.

Workers, timers, callbacks, sockets, files, subprocesses, and audio devices must
have deterministic ownership and shutdown. Repeated requests should be idempotent
or rejected clearly.

## Configuration and secrets

Layered application configuration uses this precedence:

1. built-in defaults;
2. system configuration;
3. user configuration;
4. environment variables;
5. command-line arguments.

The versioned schema, supported settings, and path behavior are documented in
[the configuration guide](configuration.md).

Secrets should be referenced rather than embedded in ordinary profiles,
Favorites data, exported configuration, logs, traces, or API responses.

Logging and diagnostic output must redact credentials, tokens, source passwords,
private endpoints when appropriate, and other secret-bearing values.

## Security and network boundaries

SDS200 UDP control, RTSP/RTP audio, scanner discovery, and FTP access are intended
for trusted local networks or trusted VPNs.

- Do not expose scanner UDP port 50536 directly to the public internet.
- Do not expose unauthenticated scanner-control or Favorites-write interfaces.
- Keep web and daemon client services local-only by default.
- Require explicit authentication and transport-security planning before remote
  access.
- Avoid wildcard-interface binds as a default.
- Treat recordings and metadata as potentially sensitive.

The project is not a safety-critical emergency receiver or dispatch system.
Scanner users must retain appropriate independent monitoring equipment and
operational procedures.

## Validation policy

Normal automated tests must not require physical scanner hardware.

Protocol and lifecycle behavior should be covered with:

- synthetic fixtures;
- sanitized captures;
- replay tests;
- deterministic fake transports;
- fault injection;
- platform-independent unit and integration tests.

Physical validation must be documented separately with scanner model, firmware,
transport, scenario, and observed limitations.

Documentation must distinguish:

- implemented behavior;
- modeled or fixture-tested behavior;
- physically validated behavior.

SDS200 network control and audio have physical validation. SDS100 USB control has
physical validation. SDS150 support is implemented and fixture-tested but physical
validation is deferred until hardware is available.

Lack of SDS150 hardware must not block unrelated releases.

## Interface direction

### Textual TUI

The Textual interface should remain a sustained-operation workstation rather than
a thin command wrapper. It should continue to use renderer-neutral state and
services for diagnostics, controls, audio, recordings, and mode-aware screens.

### Web dashboard

The responsive loopback dashboard now provides authoritative scanner and runtime
state, connection health, ordered live updates, explicit browser audio playback,
daemon-owned recording telemetry, newest-first finalized recording inventory,
safe saved-WAV playback and download, and browser-local visual presentation.

The web process remains a daemon client and does not open scanner hardware or a
second RTSP/RTP session. The dashboard also provides capability-negotiated
semantic scanner controls and browser-local System, LCARS-inspired,
Matrix-inspired, First Responder, Amateur Radio, and Pip-Boy-inspired themes over
one shared accessible structure. The stable `system` identity remains the
browser-local default and safe fallback, with scanner-display hierarchy and
automatic screen-profile presentation. One shared viewport-owned pane model
keeps scanner state, controls, audio, recordings, and diagnostics reachable
without document or active-pane scrolling at normal zoom in the 390x844,
800x480, 1366x768, and 1920x1080 reference sizes and larger full-screen
viewports. When text enlargement or browser zoom makes that composition too
tight, content reachability takes precedence and scrolling is restored.

The original Pip-Boy-inspired built-in reuses that semantic workspace through
the existing modular CSS package contract. Its phosphor, CRT, grid, meter, and
field-terminal treatments do not include game logos, character or corporate
artwork, screenshots, sounds, proprietary fonts, copied hardware geometry,
remote resources, or theme-owned JavaScript. System and every built-in or valid
managed web theme use the same pane shell rather than substituting theme-owned
application behavior. Theme staging remains decorative, pointer-inert,
reduced-motion aware, and independent of daemon or scanner state. The web
Waterfall renderer follows bounded daemon demand and live scanner-reported span
metadata while remaining explicitly relative and uncalibrated. It supports
bounded frame-count or duration-based history and an optional display-only
frequency pointer without scanner-side tuning. Remaining dashboard work includes
richer operational logs, additional shared branding assets, and deliberate
trusted-reverse-proxy or public/Internet access design beyond the existing
authenticated private-LAN mode.

### Home Assistant

Home Assistant must preserve the same single-owner daemon boundary rather than
opening another scanner control or RTSP/RTP session. Milestone 20.8 establishes a
generic daemon-owned MQTT publication substrate over the existing authoritative
event stream. Milestone 20.9 adds optional semantic MQTT scanner commands through
the existing daemon control boundary. Milestone 20.10 adds read-only Home
Assistant MQTT device discovery as an adapter over that generic contract,
including Home Assistant birth-triggered republication while leaving scanner
ownership and semantic state authoritative in the daemon. Milestone 20.11 packages
that existing ownership runtime and dashboard as one Home Assistant App with
Supervisor MQTT service adaptation, authenticated Ingress, persistent recordings,
and a narrowly published RTP UDP port.

The implemented sequence is:

- retain generic semantic daemon/scanner/radio/audio/recording/destination state
  and availability on MQTT without publishing every 500 ms PSI packet;
- route MQTT commands through the daemon's existing semantic scanner control
  operations rather than raw scanner keys, implemented as the opt-in Milestone
  20.9 command/response contract;
- expose Home Assistant MQTT device Discovery over the stable generic state and
  availability contract, implemented as read-only Milestone 20.10 entities with
  deterministic namespace-derived device identity and birth-triggered
  republication; and
- package one Home Assistant App around the existing daemon and web dashboard,
  implemented in Milestone 20.11 with Supervisor MQTT service adaptation,
  Ingress, writable Home Assistant `/media` recording storage, safe migration
  from legacy `/data/recordings`, and fixed UDP RTP publication without enabling
  host networking.

Milestone 20.12.1 completed Home Assistant configuration translations so the App
Configuration page can give the scanner host, MQTT topic prefix, and recording
directory user-facing names and descriptions. The recording directory description
explicitly identifies `/media` as its root without changing the existing strict
media-relative path contract. Repository-managed rendering was physically
validated on HAOS in the v0.20.2 acceptance run.

Milestone 20.12.2 completed the first-party SDS200 Lovelace card without requiring
HACS. The App safely installs the resource under Home Assistant `www`, the card
uses Home Assistant's supported state context and graphical form schema, and the
card remains read-only with respect to scanner control. Resource delivery,
manual JavaScript Module registration, picker/editor behavior, and live read-only
rendering were physically validated on HAOS in the v0.20.2 acceptance run.

Milestone 20.12.3 completed the deliberate Home Assistant control adapter over the
existing semantic daemon-control boundary. Discovery now adds four authoritative
Hold switches and Previous Channel, Next Channel, and Reconnect Scanner buttons
using seven dedicated QoS 0 non-retained topics. The adapter creates fresh
internal daemon request IDs, reuses existing typed control operations, derives
navigation only from ordered daemon-owned radio state, and clears navigation
context on scanner disconnect or event-stream resynchronization. The Home
Assistant App continues to disable the generic daemon MQTT request-envelope
command topic, and the daemon remains the sole scanner owner.

Milestone 20 release closure completed in v0.20.2 with Python-package and Home
Assistant App publication, reviewed wiki synchronization, all seventeen Discovery
components, all seven bounded scanner controls, Lovelace/configuration acceptance,
recording and audio regression validation, and single-owner behavior physically
validated through the repository-managed HAOS App.

Current Home Assistant Discovery contains twenty-four fixed components:
seventeen daemon/scanner/radio/audio/recording state and diagnostic components,
including fixed Screen Kind and optional Site, Frequency, Modulation, Service
Type, and configured Tone-Out Tone A and Tone B sensors, plus the seven bounded
scanner controls. Broader mode-specific entity growth, destination health,
richer scanner events, and GUI implementation remain separate future
considerations. Milestone 32.1 established the first authenticated remote
daemon-client transport and shared-service construction boundary. Milestone 32.2
packages ordinary-host daemon startup and explicit CLI/TUI client profiles.
Milestone 32.3 owns isolated native-Linux Docker Engine publication and one
ordinary Raspberry Pi TUI deployment; Milestone 32.4 retains advanced Home
Assistant App port exposure and the one-daemon/multiple-display physical
acceptance topology. This work does not make GUI support or public access
available.

Milestone 26.7 adds a separate responsive SDS200 Display Lovelace presentation
without changing the original compact card. Five explicit scanner-style layout
presets and three palettes share one original 4:3 grid, with a viewport-bounded
fit mode that avoids internal scrolling. Milestone 27.1 adds the fixed Screen
Kind sensor and an opt-in Auto layout with a configurable Simple or Detail scan
fallback. Both card assets remain read-only, transport-free consumers of Home
Assistant state; scanner display writes and copied manufacturer assets remain
outside the product boundary.

Milestone 29.4 adds one digest-qualified aggregate ES module for registering all
three first-party Home Assistant cards through one resource record. It preserves
the three independently packaged card modules and their individual URLs, derives
only ordered exact-digest imports from the immutable built-in registry, and does
not give the App authority to edit Home Assistant resource or dashboard state.

HACS may still be evaluated later as an optional distribution channel, but it is
not a dependency of the primary Home Assistant App repository distribution path.

### Future weather-alert and audio integration

Weather Alert Priority and live Weather Alert state should be investigated as a
future daemon/Home Assistant event source without changing scanner ownership.

Potential capabilities include:

- authoritative Weather Alert Priority enabled/disabled state when observable;
- a current Weather Alert active state suitable for Home Assistant automation;
- transition events carrying available SAME selection, weather channel,
  frequency, and scanner-reported weather mode;
- optional daemon-owned recording triggered by alert start and finalized after
  alert end, with explicit policy for an already-active recording; and
- Home Assistant automation examples built on state/events rather than a second
  scanner connection.

Live scanner audio should also be investigated as a media-compatible stream
derived from the existing daemon-owned decoded-PCM/PCMU fanout. A future Home
Assistant media source could allow registered `media_player` devices to play the
scanner without creating another SDS200 RTSP/RTP client.

Local speakers directly attached to a Home Assistant OS host are a separate
device-permission and audio-backend problem and should not be conflated with
network Home Assistant `media_player` support.

### Dashboard access boundaries

The Home Assistant App retains authenticated Ingress as its default dashboard
path. Milestone 26.1 separately provides an explicit native-host LAN mode that
binds one private, unique-local, or link-local interface, requires
password-authenticated direct TLS and one exact HTTPS origin, and keeps every
browser session behind the existing daemon fanout. Default standalone operation
remains loopback-only. Neither mode creates another scanner control, PSI, or
RTSP/RTP owner, and the native mode does not weaken the Ingress peer guard.

Milestone 32.1 established the next client/server transport boundary, and
Milestone 32.2 wires it into packaged ordinary-host startup and explicit client
profiles: one scanner-owning daemon may serve multiple authenticated thin
displays, including a Raspberry Pi kiosk browser using the native HTTPS
dashboard and a Raspberry Pi TUI using the remote daemon-client transport. Local
Unix-domain sockets remain the default. Host-facing remote listeners are opt-in,
encrypted, authenticated, bound to an exact operator-selected non-public
address and documented port, and isolated by least-privilege client identities
and bounded per-client queues. Milestone 32.3 packages one native-Linux Docker
Engine deployment in which the listener uses a fixed private address on an
isolated bridge behind one exact private-host TCP mapping while host networking
remains disabled. Its separate UDP 50000 mapping remains scanner RTP input, not
a client service. Milestone 32.4 may add advanced Home Assistant App options for
dedicated native-dashboard and daemon-client ports, but never republishes the
trusted Ingress listener or turns UDP 50000 into a client-facing service.

Trusted reverse-proxy deployment, wildcard binding, and public/Internet
exposure remain unsupported future boundaries.
Any such design must define proxy identity, forwarded-origin trust,
authentication, transport security, published-port policy, and multi-client
audio/SSE behavior without changing single-owner daemon semantics. Simply
publishing the existing Ingress port is insufficient because that listener
deliberately trusts only the Supervisor proxy peer.

### Future GUI and themes

A future desktop GUI may reuse the same services and API.

The web dashboard now provides System, LCARS-inspired, Matrix-inspired, First
Responder, Amateur Radio, and original Pip-Boy-inspired environments over one
shared accessible structure rather than separate interfaces. They use
renderer-specific structural tokens and an ARIA-hidden decorative stage for
cinematic depth, console geometry, terminal fields, dispatch instrumentation,
scanner-display presentation, and retro-futurist field-terminal details. Their
selection remains browser-local presentation state and does not alter the
renderer-neutral terminal palettes, daemon state, scanner ownership, or API
behavior. Future desktop interfaces may reuse the same semantic services while
choosing their own renderer-specific design tokens.

Scalable, theme-aware vector effects and responsive layouts should continue to
be preferred as shared visual work expands so the design can adapt to web,
terminal, desktop, documentation, 4K workstations, and compact Raspberry Pi
presentation surfaces without requiring separate semantic interfaces.

Modular theme packaging uses the interface-scoped hierarchy
`themes/<interface>/<theme-name>/`. Milestone 26.10 establishes its first
built-in implementation by extracting the five existing web themes into
versioned manifest plus declarative CSS packages with deterministic validation,
same-origin delivery, compatible pre-paint fallback, and unchanged accessible
rendering. Milestone 27.3 adds the sixth Pip-Boy-inspired package and moves all
built-in and valid managed web themes onto the shared five-pane workspace while
preserving the existing package and activation contracts. Milestone 26.11
extends that boundary to the byte-identical compact
and SDS200 Display Home Assistant modules. Their versioned manifests and
validated registry drive the existing flat App installation paths without
changing custom elements, resource URLs, configuration, or rendering. Milestone
26.12 completes the current built-in renderer sequence by packaging the exact
dark and light semantic palettes plus theme-only Textual CSS under
`themes/tui/<theme-name>/`. Rich CLI and Textual retain the same singleton
palette objects and selection behavior while shared terminal layout stays in
renderer code. `gui` remains reserved until a desktop renderer exists. A visual
family may reuse one theme name across interfaces while each package stays
independently installable and appropriate for its renderer. Theme packages may
style presentation but must not acquire scanner, daemon, MQTT, Home Assistant
service, authentication, or control authority. Milestone 26.13 establishes the
managed local third-party inventory and guarded validation, staging, collision,
rollback, recovery, and removal lifecycle. It deliberately stops before
renderer activation. Milestone 26.14 activates valid managed web CSS through a
selected-only link and same-origin digest-enforced route while preserving safe
System fallback. Milestone 26.15 activates valid managed semantic palettes and
strictly scoped presentation-only TCSS for Rich CLI and Textual through one
immutable startup registry while retaining built-in dark fallback. Executable
Home Assistant JavaScript still requires a separate interface-specific loading
and trust decision. GUI theming will be designed with the future GUI rather than
imposed before a renderer exists. Remote catalogs, update provenance, and
signatures remain later boundaries.

## Favorites Workspace

The Favorites Workspace is the Milestone 21 product area for browsing,
validating, editing, importing, exporting, and synchronizing scanner programming
data.

The initial design is grounded in the SDS100/200 File Specification v1.08 and
read-only SDS200 storage captured from firmware 1.26.01. Real scanner files
demonstrate that Favorites data must first be represented as lossless positional
records: record ordering carries hierarchy, identifier fields can be blank, and
observed records contain positional extensions not described by the specification.
The typed renderer-neutral hierarchy must therefore be a projection over
preserved source records rather than the only representation of the data.

See [Favorites format research](favorites-format-research.md).

### Read-only foundation

The first storage-facing implementation should be read-only and support:

- Favorites Lists;
- systems;
- departments;
- sites;
- channels;
- hierarchy navigation;
- search and filtering;
- schema validation;
- comparison and preview;
- preservation of unknown fields.

Automated tests should use fixtures and copied storage images rather than a live
scanner volume.

### Mandatory backup-before-write rule

Every Favorites write operation must create a complete backup before modifying the
active data set.

This is a project constraint, not an optional convenience.

A write workflow should:

1. identify and validate the target;
2. acquire an exclusive operation boundary where possible;
3. create and verify a complete backup;
4. write changes to a staging area;
5. parse and read back staged data;
6. compare staged data with the intended result;
7. replace the active data only after verification;
8. record a rollback manifest and operation report;
9. preserve the backup until explicitly removed under a separate policy.

The tool should refuse a write when backup, staging, verification, target
identity, or conflict checks cannot be completed safely.

### Storage backends

Potential backends include:

- USB mass storage with device discovery and safe handling;
- FTP on trusted local networks or VPNs;
- local copied images for testing and offline work.

The SDS200 can be configured with separate FTP accounts for read-only and
writable access. Future configuration should preserve those roles explicitly:

- the read-only Favorites backend uses only the read credential;
- a configured writable credential must never be used as an automatic fallback
  for a failed read-only login;
- the writable credential is resolved only inside an explicit write workflow
  after backup, staging, validation, and operator-intent checks;
- usernames may be stored in ordinary configuration, but passwords should be
  stored through secret references rather than plaintext profile values; and
- neither credential may appear in exported Favorites data, logs, diagnostics,
  comparison reports, backup manifests, or API responses.

The read-only and writable account blocks should be independently optional.
Supporting a writable account does not itself grant an ordinary read path or UI
write authority.

### Synchronization and conflicts

Synchronization must detect concurrent changes and avoid silent last-writer-wins
behavior.

The UI should show:

- source and target revisions;
- proposed additions, changes, and removals;
- conflicts;
- validation warnings;
- backup and rollback locations;
- the exact write plan before confirmation.

### RadioReference and MyRR

RadioReference-assisted import may provide previewable updates with provenance and
field ownership.

Users should be able to:

- review imported changes;
- choose local or external values during a conflict;
- retain local-only annotations;
- detach a record from its external source;
- identify when externally sourced data was last updated.

MyRR synchronization should be investigated only through an approved and
documented interface. The project should not scrape or rely on undocumented
private endpoints.

## Recording and audio direction

The recording stack now includes renderer-neutral identities and path policy,
configurable organization, metadata sidecars, recursive inventory, deterministic
retention planning and execution, local TUI and CLI workflows, daemon-owned
recording over the shared decoded-PCM router, and browser recording plus safe
finalized-WAV playback and download. Destructive file-management behavior must
remain explicit, inventory-bound, recoverable where practical, and disabled by
default unless the user requests it.

The audio stack includes one daemon-owned SDS200 RTSP/RTP session, accepted-PCMU
publication, single-pass decoding, decoded-PCM fanout, per-subscriber health,
explicit PortAudio, PipeWire, PulseAudio, and ALSA playback adapters, remote
destinations, daemon-backed CLI/TUI audio, and browser PCMU playback.

Remaining future audio work includes:

- bounded local decoded-PCM client subscriptions and consumption adapters;
- layered saved-playback configuration and automatic backend selection; and
- continued separation between control, recording, playback, encoder, and
  transport failures.

## Advanced scanner capabilities

The remote-command specification contains additional capabilities that require
research, fixtures, and physical evidence before support is promised.

Exploratory areas include:

- `GLT` Favorites and hierarchy retrieval;
- `FQK` Favorites quick keys;
- `QSH` Quick Search control;
- `URC` scanner recording control;
- `AST` and `APR` analysis controls;
- binary `GW2` waterfall framing only if stronger vendor documentation or
  independently reproducible wire evidence supersedes the tested SDS200
  firmware 1.26.01 LAN candidate rejection and establishes a benefit over the
  qualified text `PWF`/`GWF` data plane;
- `MNU`, `MSI`, `MSV`, and `MSB` menu operations;
- NAC, RAN, color code, area, activity, and quality details;
- conventional and trunking discovery modes;
- system-status and RF-power plot screens.

Protocol research should preserve raw evidence and avoid inventing semantics for
fields that have not been observed or documented.

## Platform direction

Linux and Raspberry Pi remain the current operational priority.

The project should preserve portable Python design and later validate Windows and
macOS behavior, but native packaging for every platform does not need to block
current milestones.

The Raspberry Pi 7-inch 800 by 480 display is a useful compact reference target.
Layouts must remain responsive rather than assuming one fixed screen size.

## Release principles

- Release only completed and validated milestone slices.
- Keep experimental or hardware-dependent claims out of stable documentation.
- Use hardware-independent CI for normal pull requests.
- Record physical validation evidence separately.
- Preserve compatibility or provide an explicit migration plan.
- Prefer small, reviewable milestone branches.
- Update the roadmap when scope is deferred, completed, split, or reordered.
- Keep the project vision broad enough that unscheduled ideas are not lost.

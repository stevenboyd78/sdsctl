# Audio subsystem architecture

Version 0.11.0 introduced hardware-validated SDS200 network audio while keeping
its lifecycle independent from scanner control. Milestone 16.1 added decoded-PCM
fanout for local playback and simultaneous recording, Milestone 18.5 added
pluggable playback adapters plus per-subscriber health and isolation, Milestone
19.3 added the renderer-neutral single-owner runtime, and Milestone 19.7 adds
bounded local publication of accepted PCMU packets before decode. Audio failures
never switch, close, or delay USB serial, UDP control, fallback profiles, or
preferred recovery.

## Layers

- `NetworkAudioTransport` performs RTSP negotiation over TCP and receives RTP over
  one UDP client port. The SDS200 requires `RTP/AVP;unicast;client_port=PORT`
  rather than the conventional RTP/RTCP port pair.
- `AudioStream` owns decoded-audio subscriptions and lifecycle without
  depending on `SDSScanner`.
- `PcmuStream` subscribes to accepted packets from the same authoritative
  `NetworkAudioTransport` and publishes them through independent bounded queues.
- `DaemonPcmuServer` serves one versioned binary PCMU subscription per admitted
  private Unix-domain client without owning the shared transport lifecycle.
- `DaemonPcmuClient` validates and receives that bounded binary stream for local
  playback or WAV recording without opening another scanner audio session.
- `AudioChunk.data` contains the raw payload type 0 G.711 mu-law bytes from one
  accepted RTP packet.
- `AudioFanoutSession` decodes each accepted packet once and submits 8 kHz mono
  signed 16-bit PCM to one or more independently buffered `PcmSink` destinations.
- `BufferedPlaybackSink` owns bounded newest-audio buffering, mute behavior,
  underflow and overflow accounting, and backend-independent playback lifecycle.
- `SoundDevicePlaybackAdapter` preserves the default PortAudio implementation;
  `PipeWirePlaybackAdapter`, `PulseAudioPlaybackAdapter`, and
  `AlsaPlaybackAdapter` provide explicit command-backed Linux alternatives.
- `PcmSinkRouter` dynamically attaches subscribers and exposes immutable health
  snapshots, ordered transitions, counters, timestamps, and redacted failures.
- `DaemonRuntime` owns scanner control, PSI, one `AudioFanoutSession`, and its
  dynamic router through one serialized lifecycle.
- `PcmWavSink` moves WAV writes to a worker thread and finalizes the
  `PcmuWavRecorder` during shutdown.
- `PcmStreamSink` writes raw PCM through a bounded nonblocking descriptor worker
  for foreground process integrations such as Asterisk custom Music on Hold.

A sink's `submit_pcm()` method must not block on device, disk, encoder, or network
I/O. Each sink owns its buffering and failure behavior so one destination cannot
hold up RTP reception or another destination. This contract is also the extension
point for future remote streaming adapters listed in [the roadmap](../ROADMAP.md).

### RTSP response framing

`RtspClient` accepts at most 64 KiB through the terminating `\r\n\r\n` of one
response header and at most 4 MiB in its declared body by default. Python callers
may select other positive integer limits with `max_response_header_bytes` and
`max_response_body_bytes`; booleans are not accepted as integers. Each socket
read is restricted to the remaining allowance. A header read may include
coalesced body bytes, but an over-limit `Content-Length` is rejected before any
additional body receive after the header is framed.

Header-limit, invalid-length, body-limit, response-read, and CSeq-mismatch
failures close and clear the RTSP client, so a later exchange requires a new
`connect()`. Their diagnostics identify the framing failure without including
the rejected header value or body contents. Ordinary non-success RTSP status
responses remain a separate protocol result.

## CLI playback and recording

Install the optional local-playback backend:

```bash
python -m pip install "sds200[playback]"
```

The Python extra installs `sounddevice`, but Linux also needs the PortAudio shared
library. On Debian or Raspberry Pi OS:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libportaudio2
```

Inspect the active PortAudio version, host APIs, default output, and available
output-capable devices without opening a scanner connection:

```bash
sdsctl audio-devices
```

PortAudio may expose Linux audio through ALSA, PipeWire or PulseAudio
compatibility, or JACK, depending on the operating-system configuration and
PortAudio build. The CLI and TUI continue to use PortAudio. Python callers can
explicitly select PipeWire, PulseAudio, or ALSA through the shared buffered
playback lifecycle when `pw-cat`, `pacat`, or `aplay` is installed.

Listen through the operating system's default output device:

```bash
sdsctl --host 192.168.0.251 audio --play
```

Play and record from the same RTSP/RTP session:

```bash
sdsctl --host 192.168.0.251 audio \
  --play \
  --output scanner-audio.wav \
  --duration 30
```

Use `--device DEVICE` to select a PortAudio output device and `--buffer-ms` to
change the bounded playback queue. Omit `--duration` to run until `Ctrl+C`. Use
`--force` to replace an existing output file. At least one of `--play` or
`--output` is required.

When the foreground daemon already owns the scanner audio session, consume its
PCMU stream instead of opening another RTSP/RTP session:

```bash
sdsctl daemon-client audio \
  --play \
  --output scanner-audio.wav
```

This explicit CLI workflow connects only to the private `pcmu.sock` service,
decodes each accepted payload locally, and reuses the same bounded playback and
WAV sinks.

The TUI can consume the same daemon-owned stream while retaining its playback,
recording, metadata, organization, and saved-recording library behavior:

```bash
sdsctl tui --daemon-client \
  --audio-playback \
  --audio-directory ~/recordings \
  --audio-metadata
```

The daemon-backed TUI also uses `daemon.sock` for capability negotiation,
authoritative snapshots, and safe controls, plus `events.sock` for ordered live
state. It does not open scanner hardware or another RTSP/RTP session. See the
[local daemon PCMU stream guide](daemon-pcmu.md) for framing, loss, socket, and
option details.

Overflow drops the oldest queued playback audio to preserve live latency.
Underflow fills the device request with silence. Both conditions are counted in
the command summary. Recording uses its own bounded worker queue and does not
perform disk writes in the RTP callback.

## Python lifecycle

```python
from pathlib import Path

from sds200 import (
    AudioFanoutSession,
    AudioStream,
    NetworkAudioTransport,
    PcmWavSink,
    PcmuWavRecorder,
    SoundDevicePlaybackSink,
)

transport = NetworkAudioTransport("192.168.0.251")
stream = AudioStream(transport)
sinks = (
    SoundDevicePlaybackSink(),
    PcmWavSink(PcmuWavRecorder(Path("scanner-audio.wav"))),
)

with AudioFanoutSession(stream, sinks):
    run_application()
```

Select an explicit Linux playback adapter without changing the fanout contract:

```python
from sds200 import BufferedPlaybackSink, PipeWirePlaybackAdapter

playback = BufferedPlaybackSink(
    name="playback:pipewire",
    adapter_factory=PipeWirePlaybackAdapter,
)
```

Use `PulseAudioPlaybackAdapter` or `AlsaPlaybackAdapter` in the same way.
Adapter construction is deferred until `BufferedPlaybackSink.start()`. PCM
submission remains bounded and nonblocking, overflow discards the oldest queued
audio, and shutdown interrupts and finalizes the backend through a bounded
lifecycle. Missing command runtimes produce an `AudioOutputError` naming the
unavailable executable.

The direct one-shot `AudioRecordingSession` API remains available for callers that
want one stream and one recorder. The TUI uses `TuiAudioSession` with a dynamic PCM
sink router: one long-lived fanout owns RTSP/RTP reception while live playback,
repeatable WAV sinks, and saved-recording playback are attached or detached without
opening a second scanner audio session.

`PcmSinkRouter.snapshot()` returns immutable router and subscriber state. Each
subscriber includes attachment and running state, health classification, sink
statistics, start and submission totals, failure counters, transition sequence
and timestamps, and a redacted last-error type. `on_transition()` publishes
ordered immutable changes, and listener or subscriber failures are isolated so
another destination, RTP reception, and scanner control continue independently.

Milestone 19.3 adds `DaemonRuntime` above these existing layers. It serializes
scanner connection, PSI startup, one audio fanout, dynamic destination ownership,
partial-start cleanup, and reverse-order shutdown. Immutable runtime snapshots
combine scanner, PSI, radio-state, audio, router, timestamp, transition, and
redacted-failure state for later local API consumers.

Milestone 19.4 adds the foreground `sdsctl daemon` process host. It owns one
runtime and one initially empty decoded-PCM router, handles SIGINT and SIGTERM
outside the signal callback, and supports systemd `Type=simple` operation.
Milestone 19.5 exposes read-only audio and router health through the private
local daemon API. Milestone 19.6 publishes audio lifecycle and decoded-PCM
destination-health transitions through the separate local event stream, but it
does not publish packet-rate PCM or PCMU audio. The separate daemon PCMU socket
publishes accepted packet payloads without changing the event protocol.
Milestone 19.9 adds explicit `sdsctl daemon-client audio`, which consumes that
daemon-owned PCMU stream, decodes each accepted payload locally, and reuses the
existing playback and WAV sinks without opening another scanner RTSP/RTP session
or daemon API connection. Milestone 19.10 adds explicit
`sdsctl tui --daemon-client` operation using the same PCMU stream together with
the authoritative daemon API and ordered event service. Live playback,
recording, metadata, saved-recording playback, and safe scanner controls remain
local TUI features, while scanner, PSI, and RTSP/RTP ownership remain in the
daemon. The top-level `audio`, `asterisk-moh`, monitor, and standalone TUI
workflows are unchanged. Decoded-PCM daemon subscriptions remain follow-on work.
See the
[daemon runtime and process guide](daemon-runtime.md),
[local daemon API guide](daemon-api.md),
[local daemon event stream guide](daemon-events.md), and
[local daemon PCMU stream guide](daemon-pcmu.md).

## Recording metadata foundation

Milestone 16.4.0 adds the renderer-neutral `RecordingMetadata` schema without
changing recording behavior. It combines immutable start and stop
`AudioSessionSnapshot` values with optional `RadioStateSnapshot` boundary state.
The versioned JSON records the WAV filename and fixed PCM format, scanner identity
and endpoint, UTC boundaries, system, department, site, channel, frequency, audio
totals, and RTP reliability counters.

`recording_metadata_path()` uses an unambiguous adjacent `<recording>.wav.json`
name. `write_recording_metadata()` serializes sorted, indented JSON through a
same-directory temporary file and refuses to replace an existing sidecar unless
`overwrite=True` is explicit.

TUI recording sidecars are opt-in. Add `--audio-metadata` with either
`--audio-directory` or `--audio-output`:

```bash
sdsctl --host 192.168.0.251 tui \
  --audio-directory ~/scanner-recordings \
  --audio-metadata
```

`ScannerTuiApp` forwards each immutable live PSI snapshot to `TuiAudioSession`.
The session captures the latest available scanner state at successful recording
start and stop boundaries, then writes the sidecar after WAV finalization.
A requested metadata-write failure marks the recording operation failed rather
than silently reporting success. Timestamp allocation also avoids an existing
sidecar, so an orphaned `<recording>.wav.json` cannot be overwritten by a later
repeatable recording. The standalone `sdsctl audio` command is unchanged because
it does not own a scanner-control PSI stream.

```python
from sds200 import RecordingMetadata, write_recording_metadata

metadata = RecordingMetadata.from_snapshots(
    started_snapshot,
    stopped_snapshot,
    scanner="SDS200",
    started_state=state_at_start,
    stopped_state=state_at_stop,
)
sidecar_path = write_recording_metadata(metadata)
```

## Recording identity components

Milestone 17.1 adds renderer-neutral `RecordingIdentity` derivation without
changing current recording paths. Identity values come from immutable finalized
metadata rather than a live mutable scanner state. Start-boundary state is
preferred, and an absent start value is filled from the stop boundary.

`safe_recording_component()` applies Unicode compatibility normalization,
collapses whitespace and punctuation to one hyphen, protects reserved portable
names, supplies an explicit fallback, and enforces a component length limit.
The identity excludes the current recording path so moving an audio-and-sidecar
pair does not change its scanner-derived organization values.

```python
from sds200 import RecordingIdentity

identity = RecordingIdentity.from_metadata(metadata)
components = identity.filename_components()

print(components["date"])
print(components["scanner"])
print(components["system"])
print(components["department"])
print(components["site"])
print(components["channel"])
```

The component map also includes `timestamp`, `endpoint`, `mode`, `frequency`,
`modulation`, `service_type`, `talkgroup_id`, and `unit_id`. Milestone 17.2
consumes these values through configurable path policies; identity derivation
itself does not rename or move recordings.

## Recording organization

Milestone 17.2 lets repeatable TUI recordings use ordered directories derived at
recording start. Supply a comma-separated list with `--audio-organize-by`; the
supported components are `scanner`, `date`, `system`, `department`, `site`, and
`channel`:

```bash
sdsctl --host 192.168.0.251 tui \
  --audio-directory ~/scanner-recordings \
  --audio-organize-by scanner,date,system,department,site,channel \
  --audio-metadata
```

Organization is opt-in. Without `--audio-organize-by`, the existing flat local
`--audio-directory` behavior and timestamp filenames remain unchanged. Each
configured value is normalized with `safe_recording_component()`; unavailable
start-boundary values become `unknown`. The `date` component uses the identity's
UTC start date.

The path is selected once from the recording start time and scanner state. A later
PSI change does not rename or move the active or finalized WAV. Collision suffixes
remain in the selected directory, and an adjacent metadata sidecar participates in
allocation so the WAV and `<recording>.wav.json` remain together.

## Recording inventory

Milestone 17.3 adds a renderer-neutral, read-only inventory for a recording root.
`scan_recording_inventory()` recursively treats each WAV file and adjacent
`<recording>.wav.json` sidecar as one managed unit. It reports compatible,
incompatible, unreadable, and missing audio together with valid, missing,
unreadable, invalid, mismatched, and orphaned metadata.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from sds200 import scan_recording_inventory

inventory = scan_recording_inventory(Path("~/scanner-recordings"))
print(inventory.summary.as_dict())

for entry in inventory.entries:
    print(entry.relative_audio_path, entry.audio_status, entry.metadata_status)
```

Inventory order is deterministic by relative path. Compatible WAV duration, file
and sidecar sizes, metadata-derived UTC start time, aggregate byte totals, and
attention counts are available without changing the filesystem. Directory
symlinks are not traversed, and managed file symlinks that resolve outside the
configured root are reported as unreadable rather than dereferenced.

This foundation does not move, rename, overwrite, or delete artifacts.

## Recording retention planning

Milestone 17.3 also provides deterministic, non-destructive retention previews.
`RecordingRetentionPolicy` supports optional maximum age, managed-unit, and
aggregate-byte limits. `plan_recording_retention()` requires an explicit
timezone-aware planning boundary for age policies and never calls the system clock
or changes the filesystem:

```python
from datetime import UTC, datetime, timedelta
from pathlib import Path

from sds200 import (
    RecordingRetentionPolicy,
    plan_recording_retention,
    scan_recording_inventory,
)

inventory = scan_recording_inventory(Path("~/scanner-recordings"))
policy = RecordingRetentionPolicy(
    maximum_age=timedelta(days=30),
    maximum_units=500,
    maximum_total_bytes=20 * 1024**3,
)
plan = plan_recording_retention(
    inventory,
    policy,
    now=datetime.now(UTC),
)

print(plan.summary.as_dict())
for decision in plan.decisions:
    print(
        decision.entry.relative_audio_path,
        decision.disposition,
        decision.reasons,
    )
```

Eligible units are evaluated oldest-first using their UTC recording timestamp and
relative path as deterministic tie-breakers. Compatible and incompatible WAV files
with valid or missing metadata may be selected. Unreadable or missing audio,
unsafe sidecars, and units without a reliable timestamp are protected and reported.
Protected units continue to count toward projected unit and byte totals, so the
plan explicitly reports limits it cannot satisfy safely.

A selected WAV and its adjacent sidecar remain one managed unit. Planning performs
no move, rename, overwrite, or deletion.

## Recording retention execution

Milestone 17.4 adds a renderer-neutral execution foundation that consumes one
existing retention plan. Execution requires the exact confirmation token derived
from that plan; a token from another policy, inventory, timestamp, or decision set
is rejected before filesystem mutation:

```python
from sds200 import (
    execute_recording_retention,
    recording_retention_confirmation_token,
)

confirmation = recording_retention_confirmation_token(plan)
result = execute_recording_retention(
    plan,
    confirmation=confirmation,
)
print(result.summary.as_dict())
```

Only decisions already marked `select` are considered. Retained and protected
entries are never added implicitly. Before each selected unit is changed, the
executor verifies the resolved inventory root, adjacent sidecar path, regular-file
types, absence of symlinks, captured sizes and modification state, and a fresh
inventory view. A stale or unsafe unit is skipped while later selected units
continue deterministically.

When metadata is present and valid, its sidecar is deleted before the WAV. A
sidecar failure preserves the WAV. A later WAV failure is reported as a partial
failure with the exact deleted-byte and file counts. Missing sidecars remain
valid managed units and require no metadata deletion. Directories and unknown
contents are never removed recursively.

The executor returns immutable completed, skipped, and failed unit reports.
Confirmation-token presentation remains separate from consent; callers must not
treat token generation alone as user approval.

### CLI retention preview and execution

`sdsctl recordings retention` exposes the same inventory, planning, and execution
services without opening a scanner connection. At least one limit is required.
The default operation is preview-only:

```bash
sdsctl recordings retention ~/scanner-recordings \
  --maximum-age-days 30 \
  --maximum-units 500 \
  --maximum-total-bytes 21474836480
```

The preview prints every decision, projected totals, whether all requested limits
can be satisfied safely, and an exact `delete:<sha256>` confirmation token. Add
`--json` for a stable document containing the complete serialized plan and token.

Execution requires both the destructive `--execute` option and the exact token
from an unchanged preview:

```bash
sdsctl recordings retention ~/scanner-recordings \
  --maximum-units 500 \
  --execute 'delete:<exact-token-from-preview>'
```

Age policies also include the planning timestamp in the confirmed plan. Repeat
the preview's `Planned at` value with `--planned-at` during execution so the exact
plan can be reconstructed:

```bash
sdsctl recordings retention ~/scanner-recordings \
  --maximum-age-days 30 \
  --planned-at '2026-08-03T08:00:00+00:00' \
  --execute 'delete:<exact-token-from-preview>'
```

A mismatched token exits with an error before mutation. Preview exits with status
1 when protected units prevent the requested limits from being satisfied.
Execution exits with status 1 when limits remain unsatisfied or any selected unit
is skipped or fails. Retained, protected, stale, unsafe, and unrelated artifacts
are never added to the execution set.

## Reliability statistics

`NetworkAudioTransport.statistics` returns an immutable session snapshot with
received datagrams and bytes, delivered packets and payload bytes, sequence gaps,
estimated packet loss, duplicates, late packets, malformed packets, unexpected
source and SSRC rejections, RTP timestamp discontinuities, missing-sample
estimates, receive and callback errors, keepalives, teardown count, sequence
endpoints, final timestamp, and SSRC.

Each PCM sink also exposes a `PcmSinkStatistics` snapshot containing submitted,
written, dropped, and queued bytes plus underflow, overflow, and callback-status
counters where applicable.

Sequence tracking begins with the first packet actually received because the
SDS200's `RTP-Info` starting sequence is not a reliable initialization value.
Synthetic fixtures exercise loss, duplicate, late, malformed, wraparound, and
backward-timestamp behavior without requiring scanner hardware.

RTP padding follows [RFC 3550 section 5.1][rfc-3550-padding]: the final padding
octet gives the number of padding octets to ignore, including itself. The RFC
does not require preceding padding octets to repeat that value. The parser
therefore rejects a zero or out-of-bounds padding count but deliberately accepts
nonuniform preceding padding bytes.

The RTP socket binds to the local IPv4 interface selected by the route to the
scanner. Packets are accepted only from the source address, server port, and SSRC
negotiated during RTSP `SETUP`; unexpected senders are counted and discarded.
Explicit `0.0.0.0` RTP binds are rejected.

[rfc-3550-padding]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3550#section-5.1

## Remote destination core

Milestone 16.3 introduces a service-neutral `RemotePcmSink` foundation before any
Broadcastify or Asterisk adapter is enabled. The sink owns a bounded newest-audio
queue and performs connection creation, blocking writes, reconnect backoff, and
connection shutdown on its worker thread. Scanner RTP reception and all other PCM
destinations therefore remain independent from a slow or failed remote service.

`RemoteDestinationConfig` rejects credentials embedded in endpoint URLs.
Credentials are represented by named `EnvironmentSecret` references and resolved
only when the worker opens an adapter connection. Resolved values are excluded from
configuration representations, snapshots, and log messages; connection exceptions
are redacted before they are retained or reported.

`RemotePcmSinkSnapshot` reports immutable queue, throughput,
connection-attempt, reconnect, failure, retry, and last-error state. Milestone 18.1
adds a renderer-neutral `health` classification, ordered transition sequence,
timezone-aware state-change timestamp, and the most recent successful-connection
and failure timestamps. `as_dict()` provides a stable serialization boundary with
ISO-formatted timestamps and the complete `PcmSinkStatistics` counter set.

`RemotePcmSink.on_transition()` subscribes to immutable
`RemotePcmSinkTransition` events. Events are emitted only when the lifecycle state
changes and include the previous and current state and health plus the resulting
snapshot. Lifecycle states map to health as follows: `connected` is healthy;
`connecting` and `backoff` are degraded; `failed` is failed; and `idle`,
`stopping`, and `stopped` are inactive.

Transition callbacks use the existing `EventBus` failure isolation, run outside
the sink condition lock, and retain sequence order when worker and shutdown
threads race. A callback may request sink shutdown without joining the worker from
itself. Listener failures therefore do not interrupt remote delivery, scanner
control, or other audio destinations.

Service adapters receive the configuration and resolved secret mapping through an
injected `RemoteConnectionFactory`. Adapter connections provide a prompt,
thread-safe `interrupt()` operation so shutdown can unblock an in-flight
`write_pcm()` before the worker finalizes the connection with `close()`. The
Broadcastify adapter below is the first production implementation; command-line
endpoint configuration is not available. The narrow `sdsctl remote-audio`
command family only inspects and migrates the cleartext-credential policy on
saved profiles.

## Saved remote-audio destination profiles

Milestone 18.2 adds the immutable `BroadcastifyDestinationProfile` model and a
dedicated `RemoteAudioProfileStore`. Remote-audio destinations are kept separate
from scanner connection profiles in the versioned file
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/sds200/remote-audio-profiles.toml`.

A minimal document contains adapter identity, endpoint fields, and the name of
the environment variable that supplies the source password:

```toml
version = 2

[destinations."county-feed"]
kind = "broadcastify"
server = "audio1.broadcastify.com"
mount = "/replace-with-technicals-mount"
environment_variable = "SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PASSWORD"
acknowledge_cleartext_credentials = false
port = 80
stream_name = "County Public Safety"
```

The profile never contains the resolved password. Calling
`to_broadcastify_config()` creates the existing validated `BroadcastifyConfig`
with an `EnvironmentSecret` reference while preserving port, metadata, FFmpeg,
buffering, timeout, reconnect-policy, and acknowledgement settings. Conversion
does not authorize transport: both source and metadata factories reject the
configuration before secret resolution or socket use while
`acknowledge_cleartext_credentials` is false. A daemon destination that refers
to such a profile fails activation; it is not silently skipped.

Version 1 files remain readable and are not rewritten merely by inspection.
Every version 1 profile migrates in memory to the safe false setting. List only
profile identity and policy state, then record the explicit acknowledgement for
one profile if the assigned ordinary-HTTP endpoint is accepted:

```bash
sdsctl remote-audio list

sdsctl remote-audio acknowledge-cleartext county-feed \
  --acknowledge-cleartext-credentials
```

The acknowledgement command requires the exact, unabbreviated long option shown
above. It acknowledges only the selected profile while atomically rewriting the
complete profile document as schema version 2; other legacy profiles remain at
the safe false setting. It never prints the endpoint, mount,
environment-variable name, or resolved credential, and it does not encrypt the
transport. To block future construction from the saved profile without deleting
it:

```bash
sdsctl remote-audio revoke-cleartext county-feed
```

Revocation changes saved policy only. An already-constructed source or metadata
worker retains its immutable acknowledged configuration. To stop an active
daemon transport, remove its destination from the daemon manifest and reload,
or stop the daemon. Reloading an unchanged manifest does not rebuild that
destination, and restarting while the false profile is still referenced causes
activation to fail rather than silently omitting the destination.

Use `--profiles-file /absolute/path/remote-audio-profiles.toml` immediately
after `remote-audio` when migrating an explicit service-account file. After the
acknowledgement is recorded, API callers can create the existing workers:

```python
from sds200 import (
    RemoteAudioProfileStore,
    create_broadcastify_metadata_publisher,
    create_broadcastify_sink,
)

profile = RemoteAudioProfileStore().get("county-feed")
config = profile.to_broadcastify_config()

broadcastify_sink = create_broadcastify_sink(config)
metadata_publisher = create_broadcastify_metadata_publisher(
    config,
    minimum_update_interval=2.0,
)
```

Profiles are returned in deterministic name order. Writes use a temporary file
followed by atomic replacement. Unsupported document versions, top-level fields,
destination kinds, and profile fields are rejected before any rewrite, so newer
or otherwise unknown configuration is not silently discarded.

The current location remains under the legacy `sds200` configuration root.
Milestone 19 will define layered system and user configuration, precedence, and
safe migration into the `sdsctl` namespace. CLI, TUI, and daemon activation of
saved remote-audio profiles are not part of Milestone 18.2.

## Reusable remote-audio encoder lifecycle

Milestone 18.4 adds public renderer-neutral contracts for pipe-backed audio encoder
processes. `AudioEncoderConfig` stores an immutable process name, command,
shutdown timeout, and bounded diagnostic limit without retaining destination
credentials or transport configuration.

`ManagedAudioEncoder` owns process startup, required pipe validation,
full-write checking for PCM input, encoded-byte reads, early-exit reporting,
interruption, stderr draining, and deterministic finalization. Its diagnostic
worker continuously drains stderr
so a verbose encoder cannot block while its error pipe fills, while retaining no
more than the configured limit. Shutdown closes encoder input, waits within the
configured deadline, escalates through terminate and kill when needed, and closes
all process streams. Interruption and finalization are idempotent, and immutable
snapshots and results expose lifecycle state without renderer-specific behavior.

Broadcastify now creates this reusable lifecycle from its existing fixed
`ffmpeg_command()`. `BroadcastifyConnection` continues to own Icecast
authentication, encoded-byte delivery, socket failures, and retry integration.
Injectable `AudioEncoderProcessFactory` implementations preserve
hardware-independent testing without adding alternative commands to saved
profiles or user-facing configuration.

Alternative encoder commands, new destination adapters, saved-profile schema
changes, and CLI, TUI, or daemon activation remain outside Milestone 18.4.

## Broadcastify feed adapter

Milestone 16.3.1 adds a Broadcastify-compatible Icecast source connection on top
of `RemotePcmSink`. Broadcastify's documented mono profile is fixed at 22.05 kHz,
16 kbps constant-bit-rate MP3. The adapter accepts the fanout layer's 8 kHz mono
signed 16-bit PCM and starts an FFmpeg process that resamples and encodes it before
a dedicated connection pump sends the MP3 bytes to the configured Icecast mount.

An approved Broadcastify feed supplies its receiver server, port, mount, and source
password on the feed owner's **Technicals** tab. Supported live-audio ports are 80,
8000, 8080, and 8500. The adapter sends static Icecast source metadata including
the stream name, scanner genre, public flag, bitrate, sample rate, and mono channel
count. Milestone 18.3 also provides optional dynamic alpha-tag updates synchronized
with live scanner state through an explicit Python API.

Install an FFmpeg build with the `libmp3lame` encoder and make the executable
available on `PATH`. Keep the source password outside application arguments and
configuration files. For an interactive shell, read it without echoing the value:

```bash
read -rsp "Broadcastify source password: " SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PASSWORD
printf '\n'
export SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PASSWORD
```

Create the sink with only an environment-variable reference in Python. Setting
the acknowledgement to true records acceptance of the documented risk; it does
not add TLS or otherwise protect the Authorization header:

```python
from sds200 import (
    BroadcastifyConfig,
    EnvironmentSecret,
    create_broadcastify_sink,
)

feed = BroadcastifyConfig(
    name="county-feed",
    server="audio1.broadcastify.com",
    port=80,
    mount="/replace-with-technicals-mount",
    password=EnvironmentSecret("SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PASSWORD"),
    stream_name="County Public Safety",
    acknowledge_cleartext_credentials=True,
)
broadcastify_sink = create_broadcastify_sink(feed)
```

Attach `broadcastify_sink` to the same `AudioFanoutSession` used for local playback
or WAV recording. Connection creation, FFmpeg input, encoded-output pumping,
reconnect backoff, and shutdown remain outside the scanner RTP callback. The
adapter's `interrupt()` path closes the Icecast socket and terminates FFmpeg so a
blocked network or encoder operation cannot hold up application shutdown.

## Broadcastify live stream metadata

`RemoteStreamMetadata` derives immutable renderer-neutral metadata from one
`RadioStateSnapshot`. Active reception uses system, department, and channel or
frequency components. Scanning, idle, stale, and unavailable states receive
explicit titles. Values are whitespace-normalized, control characters are
rejected, duplicate title components are removed case-insensitively, and rendered
titles are bounded.

`create_broadcastify_metadata_publisher()` creates a worker independent from the
PCM sink. `submit_radio_state()` performs only derivation and newest-value
enqueueing, so it can be subscribed directly to `radio.on_state()`. Exact
duplicate titles are suppressed. When updates arrive faster than publication,
only the newest pending value is retained. An optional minimum update interval
limits successful publications without blocking scanner callbacks.

```python
from sds200 import create_broadcastify_metadata_publisher

metadata_publisher = create_broadcastify_metadata_publisher(
    feed,
    minimum_update_interval=2.0,
)

metadata_publisher.start()
unsubscribe = radio.on_state(metadata_publisher.submit_radio_state)

try:
    radio.wait()
finally:
    unsubscribe()
    metadata_publisher.stop()
```

Each attempt resolves the existing environment-backed source-password reference
on the publisher worker and sends a short-lived authenticated Icecast
`/admin/metadata` request containing the configured mount, `mode=updinfo`, and
the rendered `song` title. The request follows the
[Icecast admin metadata interface][icecast-admin-metadata] and does not use,
reconnect, or interrupt the active audio source socket.

`RemoteMetadataPublisherSnapshot` exposes submission, publication, duplicate,
superseded-value, attempt, failure, retry, timestamp, pending-title,
published-title, and redacted last-error state. Publication failures use the
configured reconnect policy and remain isolated from scanner control, PSI
processing, recording, and PCM delivery.

The request and concurrency contracts have deterministic test coverage.
Acceptance of dynamic metadata by the assigned production Broadcastify service
still requires a service-account smoke test. Existing production validation
covers source authorization, routing, encoding, and audio delivery, but not the
new `/admin/metadata` request.

Broadcastify currently documents plain Icecast source ports rather than a
provider-supported TLS source endpoint. The source and metadata Basic
Authorization headers are therefore transported over an unencrypted TCP
connection. sdsctl requires explicit acknowledgement before constructing either
transport, keeps the default false during version 1 profile migration, and emits
credential-free policy diagnostics. The acknowledgement does not provide
confidentiality. Use only the server and port assigned by Broadcastify, protect
the host running the feed, and never expose the source port or credentials in
logs. Do not substitute port 443, prepend `https://`, or otherwise assume TLS
support without separate provider evidence.

and [Barix Icecast source setup][broadcastify-barix] for the service-side profile.

## Asterisk Music-on-Hold bridge

Milestone 16.3.2 adds a foreground `sdsctl asterisk-moh` bridge for Asterisk's
custom Music-on-Hold mode. Asterisk starts the command and reads raw audio from
its standard output. The bridge reserves `stdout` exclusively for 8 kHz mono
16-bit signed-linear PCM; logging and errors remain on `stderr` so text can
never corrupt the audio stream.

The bridge reuses the decoded fanout PCM directly. It does not start FFmpeg,
resample, or add an Asterisk Python dependency. `PcmStreamSink` duplicates the
output descriptor, places it in nonblocking mode, and writes from a bounded
worker queue. Short writes are completed, slow-reader overflow discards the
oldest queued audio, and a closed Asterisk pipe ends the command cleanly.

Create a network-capable profile where the Asterisk service account can read
it. The profile stores the scanner address, not a remote-service credential:

```bash
sudo install -d -o asterisk -g asterisk /etc/asterisk/sds200
sudo -u asterisk /opt/sds200/.venv/bin/sdsctl \
  --config /etc/asterisk/sds200/profiles.toml \
  profile add scanner-moh --host 192.168.0.251
```

Add a custom class to `musiconhold.conf`. Use the absolute path to the installed
`sdsctl` executable because Asterisk services commonly have a restricted
`PATH`:

```ini
[scanner]
mode=custom
application=/opt/sds200/.venv/bin/sdsctl --config /etc/asterisk/sds200/profiles.toml --profile scanner-moh asterisk-moh
format=slin
kill_escalation_delay=5000
```

Asterisk's sample configuration defines `mode=custom` as an application whose
output Asterisk consumes and uses `format` to identify that output. `slin` is
the 8 kHz signed-linear format, matching the SDS200 fanout's 8 kHz, mono,
little-endian 16-bit PCM. The longer escalation delay gives RTSP teardown and
worker cleanup time after Asterisk sends `SIGHUP`; the command also handles
`SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`. The default process-group kill method is retained so
Asterisk's escalation also reaches any service wrapper or descendants.

Reload Music on Hold and confirm the class is visible:

```bash
asterisk -rx "module reload res_musiconhold.so"
asterisk -rx "moh show classes"
```

For a service-account smoke test outside Asterisk, capture a few seconds of raw
signed-linear audio. `timeout` sends `SIGTERM`, which the bridge converts into
an orderly stop:

```bash
sudo -u asterisk timeout --signal=TERM 5 \
  /opt/sds200/.venv/bin/sdsctl \
  --config /etc/asterisk/sds200/profiles.toml \
  --profile scanner-moh asterisk-moh > /tmp/scanner-moh.sln
```

The Asterisk service account must be able to reach the scanner's RTSP and RTP
ports. Keep that traffic on the same trusted LAN or secured VPN described
below. See Asterisk's [Music-on-Hold sample configuration][asterisk-moh-sample]
and [audio-format reference][asterisk-audio-formats] for the custom-process and
signed-linear contracts.

## Remote audio validation

Milestone 16.3.3 validates the remote-audio pipeline against a physical SDS200
running firmware 1.26.01. The validation host ran Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, Python
3.14.4, FFmpeg 8.0.1 with `libmp3lame`, and Asterisk 22.5.2.

### Asterisk service validation

The `scanner` custom Music-on-Hold class was installed under the `asterisk`
service account with an absolute `sdsctl` path, a service-readable saved network
profile, `format=slin`, the default process-group kill method, and a 5-second
kill-escalation delay.

A direct service-account capture submitted and wrote 136,320 PCM bytes with zero
drops. A Local-channel Asterisk test then recorded exactly 15 seconds of mono,
8 kHz, 16-bit signed-linear audio: 120,000 frames, 119,865 nonzero samples, a
peak amplitude of 10,876, and RMS amplitude of 2,960.45. A normal module reload
retained the unchanged custom source. A controlled module unload removed the
bridge without leaving an orphan, and loading the module recreated the bridge
with a distinct process ID.

### Broadcastify-compatible loopback validation

Two manual validators exercise the production Broadcastify adapter with the
physical scanner and real FFmpeg encoder while keeping all traffic on
`127.0.0.1:8500`:

- `scripts/validate_broadcastify_loopback.py` accepts one Icecast-compatible
  source session, verifies and sanitizes its request, captures the MP3 stream,
  probes its codec profile, decodes it, and rejects silence or PCM loss.
- `scripts/validate_broadcastify_reconnect.py` deliberately resets the first
  source connection, requires a successful retry and second source session, and
  verifies post-reconnect encoded audio and cleanup.

Set `SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PASSWORD` to an ephemeral local test value before
running either validator; the value is checked during authentication but never
written to the evidence files. Stop any other SDS200 RTSP/RTP audio consumer
before starting a validation run.

```bash
export SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PASSWORD="$(
  python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))'
)"

python scripts/validate_broadcastify_loopback.py \
  --host 192.168.0.251 \
  --duration 15 \
  --acknowledge-cleartext-credentials \
  --output-dir /tmp/sds200-broadcastify-loopback

python scripts/validate_broadcastify_reconnect.py \
  --host 192.168.0.251 \
  --drop-after-bytes 4096 \
  --post-reconnect-duration 10 \
  --acknowledge-cleartext-credentials \
  --output-dir /tmp/sds200-broadcastify-reconnect

unset SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PASSWORD
```

The uninterrupted loopback delivered 376 RTP packets and 120,320 audio samples
with every RTP reliability counter at zero. All 240,640 submitted PCM bytes were
written without drops or queue overflow. The captured stream was mono MP3 at
22.05 kHz and 16 kbps, with 14.811 seconds of decoded non-silent audio.

The forced-disconnect run delivered 339 RTP packets without transport loss or
callback errors. It recorded two connection attempts, two successful
connections, one failure, and one reconnect. The interrupted write accounted
for 640 dropped PCM bytes while queue overflows remained zero. The second source
session produced 10.005 seconds of non-silent mono MP3 at 22.05 kHz and 16 kbps.
Both runs stopped FFmpeg cleanly.

These loopback results validate scanner reception, secret handling, Icecast
request construction, MP3 encoding, retry/backoff, reconnection, and shutdown.

### Live Broadcastify service validation

`scripts/validate_broadcastify_live.py` validates the assigned production feed
without accepting credentials on the command line or retaining endpoint details
in its evidence file. Set the assigned server, port, mount, stream name, and
source password through environment variables, then stop any competing SDS200
audio consumer before running the validator:

```bash
export SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_SERVER='assigned receiver server'
export SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PORT='assigned source port'
export SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_MOUNT='/assigned mount'
export SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_STREAM_NAME='approved feed name'

read -rsp 'Broadcastify source password: ' SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PASSWORD
printf '\n'
export SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PASSWORD

python scripts/validate_broadcastify_live.py \
  --host 192.168.0.251 \
  --duration 60 \
  --acknowledge-cleartext-credentials \
  --output /tmp/sds200-broadcastify-live-summary.json

unset SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PASSWORD
unset SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_SERVER
unset SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_PORT
unset SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_MOUNT
unset SDS200_BROADCASTIFY_STREAM_NAME
```

The assigned production service accepted the source on the first connection
attempt over its assigned port. The 60-second run delivered 1,505 RTP packets
and 481,600 audio samples, representing 60.200 seconds of decoded audio. All
963,200 submitted PCM bytes were written with zero drops or queue overflows.
The transport reported no packet loss, sequence gaps, duplicate, late,
malformed, unexpected-source, SSRC-mismatch, timestamp, receive, or callback
errors. Shutdown sent RTSP teardown, left the sink stopped with an empty queue,
and left no FFmpeg process running.

The retained JSON contains counters and state only. It excludes the source
password, receiver server, assigned mount, and approved feed name. Together
with the loopback and forced-disconnect results, this validates production
Broadcastify authorization and routing, the fixed MP3 encoder profile, scanner
audio delivery, secret handling, recovery behavior, and orderly shutdown.

## SDS200 LAN security

The protocol is unauthenticated and unencrypted. Keep RTSP TCP port 554 and its
negotiated RTP UDP port on a trusted LAN or behind a secured VPN. Remote streaming
credentials must not be passed through command-line arguments or written to logs.

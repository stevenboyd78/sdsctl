# Local daemon API

The foreground `sdsctl daemon` process exposes a versioned, renderer-neutral
request-response API through the private local `daemon.sock` Unix-domain
stream socket.

Milestone 19.5 introduced strict read-only capability and snapshot operations.
Milestone 19.8 preserves those version 1 operations and adds explicit,
capability-checked scanner controls for hold, next, previous, and reconnect.
The protocol does not expose unrestricted raw scanner-command passthrough.

Ordered events, accepted PCMU packets, and finalized recording bytes remain
separate services:

- [local daemon event stream](daemon-events.md) through `events.sock`;
- [local daemon PCMU stream](daemon-pcmu.md) through `pcmu.sock`; and
- finalized inventory-approved WAV access through `recordings.sock`, documented
  with the [web dashboard](web-dashboard.md) and
  [daemon deployment guide](daemon-deployment.md).

Milestone 19.9 adds explicit `sdsctl daemon-client` status, snapshot, hold,
next, previous, and reconnect workflows through the reusable `DaemonApiClient`.
The separate `events` and `audio` actions consume `events.sock` and `pcmu.sock`
without opening this API connection. Milestone 19.10 adds explicit daemon-backed
TUI operation. Milestone 20.5 adds `recording.status`, `recording.start`,
`recording.stop`, and `recordings.list` plus matching reusable
`DaemonApiClient` methods for web recording workflows. The top-level scanner and
direct-audio commands remain standalone, while decoded-PCM client workflows
remain follow-on work. Integrations may also use the documented socket framing
and version contract directly.

The Python implementation retains the historical public class name
`DaemonReadOnlyApi` for compatibility even though version 1 now advertises both
read-only and control operations.

## Starting the API

The local API starts automatically with the foreground daemon:

```bash
sdsctl --log-level INFO --host 192.168.0.251 daemon
```

Socket-path resolution uses this precedence:

1. an explicit absolute `--socket-path`;
2. `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/sdsctl/daemon.sock`; or
3. the resolved user state directory followed by `daemon.sock`, normally
   `$XDG_STATE_HOME/sdsctl/daemon.sock` or
   `~/.local/state/sdsctl/daemon.sock`.

An explicit path overrides the environment:

```bash
sdsctl --host 192.168.0.251 daemon \
  --socket-path /run/user/1000/sdsctl-custom/daemon.sock
```

The parent directory for an explicit path must already exist and remains
caller-managed. For default runtime or user-state locations, the daemon creates
the final `sdsctl` directory when needed and sets its mode to `0700`. The socket
entry is set to `0600`.

The daemon refuses:

- a symlink as the final parent directory;
- a symlink or non-socket entry at the socket path;
- an existing socket that accepts a connection; and
- a socket whose filesystem identity changes during stale-socket probing.

An unresponsive socket is removed only after connection refusal and a matching
device and inode check. The daemon never replaces an active endpoint.

## Transport, framing, and limits

The transport is an `AF_UNIX`, `SOCK_STREAM` socket. Requests and responses are
UTF-8 JSON Lines: each JSON value is terminated by one newline.

One connection may submit multiple requests. Responses remain ordered for that
connection. Separate admitted clients are handled independently. Scanner
mutations are serialized by the daemon runtime rather than by a client
connection.

Default server limits are:

| Limit | Default |
| --- | ---: |
| Concurrent clients | 8 |
| Request size | 65,536 bytes |
| Response size | 1,048,576 bytes |
| Idle client timeout | 5 seconds |
| Indexed/reconnect control deadline | 2 seconds |
| Semantic hold-state deadline | 4 seconds |
| Worker shutdown deadline | 5 seconds |

The corresponding daemon options are:

```text
--api-max-clients COUNT
--api-max-request-bytes BYTES
--api-max-response-bytes BYTES
--api-client-timeout SECONDS
--api-shutdown-timeout SECONDS
```

The API server requires its worker shutdown deadline to be greater than the
maximum request duration. This prevents a valid bounded control request from
exceeding the configured worker-shutdown contract.

An excess connection is closed without admitting a worker. An idle client is
closed after its timeout. An oversized request receives a
`request_too_large` response when possible and that connection is then closed.
Shutdown closes the listener and connected clients before waiting for bounded
worker completion.

## Request envelope

Every request is a JSON object with these required fields:

- `protocol`: the exact string `sdsctl.daemon`;
- `version`: protocol version `1`;
- `request_id`: a non-empty client correlation string; and
- `operation`: the requested operation name.

`params` is optional and defaults to an empty object. Allowed parameters depend
on the selected operation. Read-only operations reject non-empty parameters.
Control operations use the strict contracts documented below.

A request identifier is limited to 128 characters and must not contain control
characters. Request objects are strict: missing fields and unexpected fields
are rejected.

Example request:

```json
{"operation":"ping","params":{},"protocol":"sdsctl.daemon","request_id":"example-1","version":1}
```

## Response envelope

A successful response contains `result`:

```json
{"ok":true,"protocol":"sdsctl.daemon","request_id":"example-1","result":{"pong":true},"version":1}
```

A failed response contains `error` with a stable machine-readable `code` and a
human-readable `message`:

```json
{"error":{"code":"unknown_operation","message":"Unknown daemon API operation: 'scanner.delete'."},"ok":false,"protocol":"sdsctl.daemon","request_id":"example-1","version":1}
```

A response contains exactly one of `result` or `error`. When malformed JSON,
invalid UTF-8, or an invalid request identifier prevents safe correlation,
`request_id` is `null`.

Internal runtime exceptions are redacted. Clients receive stable error codes
without scanner response contents, endpoint secrets, or underlying exception
messages.

## Capability negotiation

`hello` and `daemon.capabilities` advertise:

- protocol name and supported versions;
- every operation available in the running daemon;
- `read_only: false`;
- the backward-compatible `read_only_operations` set;
- the explicit scanner `control_operations` set;
- `max_control_timeout`, currently `2.0` seconds for compatibility indexed
  navigation and reconnect; and
- `max_hold_state_timeout`, currently `4.0` seconds when
  `scanner.hold_state` is advertised.

Recording operations appear in `operations` only when a recording manager is
configured. `recording.status` and `recordings.list` are also advertised as
read-only operations; `recording.start` and `recording.stop` mutate recording
state but are intentionally separate from scanner `control_operations`.

`hello` additionally returns `selected_version`.

Clients should negotiate capabilities rather than infer support from the
historical Python class name.

## Read-only operations

| Operation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `hello` | Capabilities plus the selected protocol version |
| `daemon.capabilities` | Supported versions, operations, operation groups, and limits |
| `ping` | `{"pong": true}` |
| `runtime.snapshot` | Complete authoritative `DaemonRuntimeSnapshot.as_dict()` payload |
| `scanner.state` | Endpoint, optional model and firmware identity, connection and PSI state, and current radio state |
| `audio.health` | Audio-session and decoded-PCM router snapshots |
| `recording.status` | Complete daemon-owned recording workflow snapshot |
| `recordings.list` | Bounded newest-first finalized recording inventory |

`hello`, `daemon.capabilities`, `ping`, `recording.status`, and
`recordings.list` do not read the runtime snapshot. `runtime.snapshot`,
`scanner.state`, and `audio.health` obtain one authoritative runtime snapshot
for that request. Recording operations use the daemon recording manager's own
authoritative snapshot or inventory result.

New daemon snapshots include `scanner_model` and `scanner_firmware` as
non-empty strings when identity probes succeed, or `null` when an individual
probe fails. Version 1 clients continue accepting older snapshots that omit
these additive fields. A failed identity probe does not stop daemon-owned
scanner control, PSI, or audio.

## Recording operations

Milestone 20.5 adds four parameterless recording operations when the daemon owns
a configured recording manager:

| Operation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `recording.status` | Current daemon-owned recording snapshot |
| `recording.start` | Snapshot after attaching a new WAV sink to the shared decoded-PCM router |
| `recording.stop` | Snapshot after detaching and finalizing the active recording |
| `recordings.list` | Bounded newest-first inventory of finalized playable recording artifacts |

Browser or API clients do not provide filesystem paths. The daemon's
`RecordingPathPolicy` chooses the recording root and identity, and finalized
file bytes are read separately through the private `recordings.sock` service
using an inventory-relative identifier. Starting or stopping recording never
opens another scanner RTSP/RTP session.

An active recording is daemon-owned rather than browser-owned, so it survives a
browser reload or complete web-process disconnect. Daemon shutdown closes the
recording manager before destination and audio-runtime teardown so an active WAV
can be finalized while the shared router is still available.

Stable recording failures are:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `recording_busy` | A recording is already active or awaiting finalization |
| `recording_unavailable` | The recording manager or required runtime state is unavailable |
| `recording_failed` | A redacted recording start, stop, finalization, inventory, or filesystem operation failed |

Clients should obtain current state from `recording.status`, authoritative
`stream.snapshot` payloads, and ordered `recording.state` events rather than
assuming that a disconnected request client owns the recording lifecycle.

## Scanner control operations

The API accepts only documented typed operations. It never accepts an arbitrary
scanner command string.

| Operation | Parameters |
| --- | --- |
| `scanner.hold` | Required `target`; optional `first`, `second`, and `timeout` |
| `scanner.hold_state` | Required `scope` and boolean `held`; optional `timeout` |
| `scanner.next` | Required `target`; optional `first`, `second`, `count`, and `timeout` |
| `scanner.previous` | Required `target`; optional `first`, `second`, `count`, and `timeout` |
| `scanner.reconnect` | Optional `timeout` only |
| `scanner.volume_set` | Required non-negative integer `level`; optional `timeout` |
| `scanner.squelch_set` | Required non-negative integer `level`; optional `timeout` |

Navigation targets are limited to:

- `SYS`
- `DEPT`
- `SITE`
- `CFREQ`
- `TGID`
- `STGID`
- `WX`
- `FTO`
- `CCHIT`
- `CS_FREQ`
- `QS_FREQ`

Targets are normalized to uppercase. `first` and `second` may be strings,
integers, or `null`, but may not contain commas or line breaks. Navigation
`count` defaults to `1` and must be an integer from `1` through `8`.

Compatibility indexed navigation and reconnect `timeout` values default to
`2.0` seconds and may not exceed `max_control_timeout`. Semantic
`scanner.hold_state` defaults to `4.0` seconds and may not exceed
`max_hold_state_timeout`. Exact volume and squelch operations use the normal
two-second control deadline. The scanner model's typed command validation
provides the upper bound; the API does not assume that SDS100/SDS150 and SDS200
share one range.

Example indexed hold request:

```json
{"operation":"scanner.hold","params":{"first":42,"target":"SYS","timeout":1.5},"protocol":"sdsctl.daemon","request_id":"hold-1","version":1}
```

Example semantic desired-state request:

```json
{"operation":"scanner.hold_state","params":{"held":false,"scope":"channel","timeout":4.0},"protocol":"sdsctl.daemon","request_id":"hold-state-1","version":1}
```

`scope` is limited to `system`, `department`, `site`, or `channel`. `held` must
be a JSON boolean. The daemon reads authoritative `GSI` before acting, returns
success without a key press when the requested state already matches, and
otherwise executes only the allowlisted verified hold gesture. Enabling a hold
requires an available current selection. Releasing a held scope remains valid
even when its current selection index has become the SDS200 unsigned-32
no-current-selection sentinel.

There is no separate `scanner.resume` operation and no generic public
`scanner.key` passthrough. Release is the explicit desired state
`scanner.hold_state(..., held=false)`. The indexed `scanner.hold` contract remains
unchanged for compatibility.

Exact level requests use `scanner.volume_set` and `scanner.squelch_set`. Literal
zero is valid. The daemon executes the existing typed `VOL` or `SQL` command,
accepts the firmware's `VOL,OK` or `SQL,OK` acknowledgement, and confirms the
requested value with the matching authoritative scalar getter before returning
success. The getter-confirmed level is merged into the shared completion snapshot
without clearing unrelated state. These raw levels do not imply percentage,
loudness, or mute state.

Physical SDS200 firmware 1.26.01 UDP acceptance passed through both direct and
daemon-owned LAN paths. Each path changed and restored volume `0` to `1` to `0`
and squelch `2` to `3` to `2`. No optimistic value is returned, and a missing or
mismatched getter result still produces `control_timeout`.

### Reconnect availability

`scanner.reconnect` is supported only when the daemon directly owns an SDS200
`UdpTransport`. Serial, fallback, replay, injected, or otherwise unbounded
transport implementations receive `unsupported_operation`.

This restriction keeps the daemon request and shutdown deadlines enforceable.
Standalone `SDSScanner.reconnect()` remains available to existing Python and
CLI/TUI workflows according to their selected transport behavior.

## Completion and concurrency semantics

A successful control response is returned only after the scanner command has
completed authoritatively:

- navigation operations require the matching scanner `OK` acknowledgement;
- semantic hold-state performs an authoritative `GSI` read before the gesture,
  then polls `GSI` until the requested hold field reaches the desired state;
- exact volume and squelch controls validate the connected model's bounds and
  poll the matching authoritative scalar getter until the requested raw level is
  current;
- reconnect must reopen the supported control transport and restore an active
  PSI interval before completion;
- the runtime increments one control sequence after success; and
- the result includes the authoritative runtime snapshot captured at
  completion.

Successful control results contain:

- `sequence`;
- `operation`;
- aware UTC `started_at`;
- aware UTC `completed_at`; and
- `snapshot`.

Only one daemon-owned scanner mutation may execute at a time. A concurrent
control is rejected immediately with `control_busy`; it is not queued behind
the in-flight request.

The caller's control deadline includes waiting for runtime lifecycle ownership
and scanner completion. Expiration produces `control_timeout`. Runtime shutdown
waits for an already executing bounded control before releasing scanner
ownership.

API workers are separate from PSI processing, RTP reception, event publication,
and PCMU delivery. The existing snapshot and ordered-event services remain the
authoritative observation paths for resulting state changes.

## Error codes

Version 1 defines these stable error codes:

- `invalid_request`
- `unsupported_protocol`
- `unsupported_version`
- `unknown_operation`
- `invalid_parameters`
- `control_busy`
- `control_unavailable`
- `unsupported_operation`
- `control_timeout`
- `control_rejected`
- `control_failed`
- `recording_busy`
- `recording_unavailable`
- `recording_failed`
- `request_too_large`
- `internal_error`

Important control classifications are:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `control_busy` | Another scanner mutation is already in progress |
| `control_unavailable` | Runtime or required connection state is unavailable |
| `unsupported_operation` | Scanner model, capability, or transport cannot safely perform the operation |
| `control_timeout` | The bounded control did not complete before its deadline |
| `control_rejected` | The scanner explicitly returned `NG`, `ERR`, or `ERROR` |
| `control_failed` | Another redacted scanner or transport failure occurred |
| `recording_busy` | A daemon recording is already active or awaiting finalization |
| `recording_unavailable` | Daemon recording is not currently available |
| `recording_failed` | A redacted daemon recording operation failed |

Clients should branch on `error.code`, not the human-readable message.

## CLI client

The explicit CLI client uses the daemon API without opening scanner hardware:

```bash
sdsctl daemon-client status
sdsctl daemon-client snapshot
sdsctl daemon-client hold TGID 12345
sdsctl daemon-client hold-state channel off
sdsctl daemon-client volume 10
sdsctl daemon-client squelch 2
sdsctl daemon-client next TGID 12345 --count 1
sdsctl daemon-client previous TGID 12345 --count 1
sdsctl daemon-client reconnect
```

Use `--socket-path PATH` before the action when the daemon owns a non-default API
socket. `--timeout` bounds connection and API response waits.
`--max-response-bytes` limits one accepted response. Status and control
workflows negotiate advertised operations before use, and successful controls
print or return the authoritative completion result.

The daemon client is always explicit. It does not silently replace the existing
standalone scanner commands.

## Minimal Python client

This example uses the default XDG runtime socket and sends one `ping` request:

```python
import json
import os
import socket
from pathlib import Path

path = Path(os.environ["XDG_RUNTIME_DIR"]) / "sdsctl" / "daemon.sock"
request = {
    "protocol": "sdsctl.daemon",
    "version": 1,
    "request_id": "ping-1",
    "operation": "ping",
    "params": {},
}

with socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as client:
    client.connect(str(path))
    client.sendall((json.dumps(request) + "\n").encode("utf-8"))

    response = bytearray()
    while not response.endswith(b"\n"):
        chunk = client.recv(4096)
        if not chunk:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "Daemon closed the connection before responding."
            )
        response.extend(chunk)

print(json.loads(response))
```

Use the user-state fallback path instead when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is not defined,
or start the daemon with an explicit absolute `--socket-path`.

## Physical SDS200 validation

The read-only Milestone 19.5 API was validated on 2026-08-04 against a physical
SDS200 at `192.168.0.251`:

- the managed XDG socket directory used mode `0700` and the socket used
  mode `0600`;
- `hello`, `daemon.capabilities`, `ping`, `runtime.snapshot`,
  `scanner.state`, and `audio.health` returned successful correlated
  responses;
- the authoritative runtime reported `running`, connected scanner control,
  active PSI, active RTSP/RTP audio, and a running decoded-PCM router;
- malformed JSON returned `invalid_request`, after which the same connection
  completed another valid request;
- a second concurrent client completed capability negotiation independently;
- the daemon received seven RTP packets and 2,240 decoded samples during the
  validation run; and
- systemd-style `SIGTERM` produced exit status 0 and removed the owned socket.

The Milestone 19.8 safe controls were physically validated on 2026-08-05
against the same SDS200:

- capability negotiation advertised hold, next, previous, and reconnect with the
  two-second maximum deadline;
- TGID hold activated, next changed the held selection, previous returned to the
  held selection, and the second hold restored the scanner to `Off`;
- all five scanner-acknowledged operations returned increasing control sequences
  and authoritative snapshots reporting a running runtime, connected scanner,
  active PSI and audio, and a running router;
- bounded reconnect emitted both scanner connection transitions while the API
  connection remained usable;
- the simultaneous-client run completed 16 correlated API pings and 82 ordered
  events without a sequence gap;
- two PCMU clients each received the same 410 frames and 131,200 payload bytes
  without local loss, RTP loss, timestamp reversal, or mismatched overlap; and
- controlled `SIGTERM` returned exit status 0 and removed `daemon.sock`,
  `events.sock`, and `pcmu.sock`.

## Lifecycle and current exclusions

`DaemonProcess` starts the event listener, starts the PCMU listener, starts the
ownership runtime, activates configured destinations, starts the finalized
recording-file service, and finally opens the request-response API. Every
admitted API request therefore observes an initialized runtime and configured
recording service, while event subscribers may observe startup transitions and
PCMU subscribers are ready before authoritative audio begins.

Shutdown closes the API listener and clients, closes finalized recording-file
readers, closes the recording manager so an active WAV can be finalized, stops
configured destinations, and then stops scanner, PSI, audio, and router
ownership. The PCMU service stops after the runtime, and the separate event
service remains available for final lifecycle transitions and stops last.

If service startup fails, every attempted component is cleaned up. Cleanup
continues after an individual failure, while the primary startup or process
error remains authoritative.

The `daemon.sock` protocol intentionally excludes:

- unrestricted raw scanner-command passthrough;
- generic public `KEY` passthrough and unverified key modes or gestures;
- streaming event responses on an API connection;
- binary PCM, PCMU, or finalized-WAV delivery on the API connection;
- TCP or remote-network exposure;
- daemon discovery or automatic client selection;
- decoded-PCM CLI client workflows; and
- destination activation or configuration reload.

Ordered events are available through their dedicated socket and
`sdsctl daemon-client events`. Daemon-owned PCMU audio is available through
`pcmu.sock` and `sdsctl daemon-client audio`. Finalized recording bytes are
available through `recordings.sock` to inventory-aware clients such as the web
dashboard. The daemon-backed TUI obtains its authoritative initial state and
safe-control results through this API while ordered updates and PCMU audio remain
on their dedicated sockets.

Automatic daemon discovery and decoded-PCM client workflows remain follow-on
work. Explicit CLI and TUI daemon clients, browser recording operations, saved
destination activation, and transactional `SIGHUP` destination reload are part
of the current daemon contract.

# Layered application configuration

`sdsctl` loads optional application-wide operational settings from versioned
TOML files, environment variables, and explicit command-line options.

This application configuration is separate from saved scanner connection
profiles. The existing global `--config PATH` option still selects the legacy
connection-profile document; it does not select an application configuration
file.

## Precedence

Values are resolved in this fixed order, from lowest to highest precedence:

1. built-in defaults;
2. system configuration;
3. user configuration;
4. `SDSCTL_*` environment variables;
5. explicit command-line arguments.

Absent values do not override lower-precedence sources. An explicitly supplied
value remains an override even when it equals the built-in default.

The verbosity shortcuts are explicit command-line logging overrides:

- `-v` selects `INFO`;
- `-vv` selects `DEBUG`;
- `--log-level LEVEL` takes priority when supplied with a verbosity shortcut.

## Paths

The optional application configuration files are:

- system: `/etc/sdsctl/config.toml`;
- user: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/sdsctl/config.toml`.

The default daemon destination manifest is:

- `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/sdsctl/daemon-destinations.toml`.

The default optional daemon MQTT manifest is:

- `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/sdsctl/daemon-mqtt.toml`.

The destination and MQTT manifests are separate versioned daemon documents; they
are not fields in the flat application configuration schema.

Path resolution also defines persistent service locations:

- state: `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/sdsctl/`;
- cache: `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/sdsctl/`.

Resolving or loading configuration does not create directories or files.
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` must be absolute when
set.

Known legacy files remain in the `sds200` configuration root:

- `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/sds200/profiles.toml`;
- `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/sds200/remote-audio-profiles.toml`.

Milestone 19.1 provides read-only legacy discovery. It does not move, replace,
rewrite, or delete legacy data.

## TOML document

Application configuration documents use schema version 1. The `[application]`
table is optional, so a document containing only the version is valid.

```toml
version = 1

[application]
max_xml_retries = 4
reconnect_attempts = 8
reconnect_initial_delay = 1.0
reconnect_multiplier = 2.0
reconnect_max_delay = 30.0
health_history_limit = 250
color = "auto"
theme = "dark"
log_level = "INFO"
log_file = "/var/log/sdsctl.log"
```

Unknown top-level fields, unsupported application fields, malformed TOML,
unsupported versions, invalid types, invalid ranges, and non-finite numeric
values are rejected before scanner startup. Diagnostics identify the source and
path without including unsupported field values.

## Supported settings

| TOML field | Built-in default | Environment variable | CLI option |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `max_xml_retries` | `2` | `SDSCTL_MAX_XML_RETRIES` | `--max-xml-retries` |
| `reconnect_attempts` | `0` | `SDSCTL_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS` | `--reconnect-attempts` |
| `reconnect_initial_delay` | `1.0` | `SDSCTL_RECONNECT_INITIAL_DELAY` | `--reconnect-initial-delay` |
| `reconnect_multiplier` | `2.0` | `SDSCTL_RECONNECT_MULTIPLIER` | `--reconnect-multiplier` |
| `reconnect_max_delay` | `30.0` | `SDSCTL_RECONNECT_MAX_DELAY` | `--reconnect-max-delay` |
| `health_history_limit` | `100` | `SDSCTL_HEALTH_HISTORY_LIMIT` | `--health-history-limit` |
| `color` | `auto` | `SDSCTL_COLOR` | `--color`, `--no-color` |
| `theme` | `dark` | `SDSCTL_THEME` | `--theme` |
| `log_level` | unset | `SDSCTL_LOG_LEVEL` | `--log-level`, `-v`, `-vv` |
| `log_file` | unset | `SDSCTL_LOG_FILE` | `--log-file` |

`reconnect_attempts = 0` means retry indefinitely. Delay values must be positive,
the multiplier must be at least `1`, and the maximum delay must be at least the
initial delay.

`color` accepts `auto`, `always`, or `never`. When the resolved value is `auto`,
the presentation layer continues to honor `NO_COLOR` and `FORCE_COLOR` as
documented in [Presentation and accessibility](presentation.md).

`theme` accepts `dark` or `light`. Both values resolve the validated built-in
terminal packages shared by Rich CLI and Textual. Managed third-party packages
use `<user-config>/sdsctl/themes/<interface>/<theme-name>/`; the location follows
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and can be overridden for one lifecycle invocation with
`sdsctl themes --root DIRECTORY ...`. A new `sdsctl web` process automatically
discovers valid packages under its resolved `themes/web/` directory; no theme
configuration field is added because selection stays browser-local. Managed
terminal and Home Assistant packages remain inactive. Logging levels are
`CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, or `DEBUG`.

## Environment examples

```bash
export SDSCTL_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS=8
export SDSCTL_HEALTH_HISTORY_LIMIT=250
export SDSCTL_THEME=light
export SDSCTL_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

sdsctl --profile home monitor
```

Environment parsing reports the variable name and expected type without echoing
the rejected value.

## Explicit CLI overrides

Command-line settings have the highest precedence:

```bash
SDSCTL_THEME=light \
  sdsctl --theme dark --reconnect-attempts 0 --profile home monitor
```

Here, the explicit dark theme and unlimited reconnect policy override the
environment and both TOML files.

## Daemon MQTT configuration

Milestone 20.8 adds a separate strict version 1
`daemon-mqtt.toml` document for the optional daemon-owned broker integration.
Its `[broker]` table configures host, port, client ID, username, password
environment-variable reference, topic prefix, QoS, semantic-state retention,
keepalive, and reconnect policy. Milestone 20.9 adds `commands_enabled`, which
defaults to `false` and explicitly opts the same worker into the daemon's
semantic scanner-control request/response contract. Milestone 20.10 adds an
optional strict `[home_assistant]` table with `enabled`, `discovery_prefix`,
`birth_topic`, and `birth_payload`. Discovery is disabled by default and uses the
existing semantic state and availability topics rather than creating another
scanner owner or state path. An absent file means MQTT is disabled and does not
require the optional Paho dependency.

The daemon accepts `--mqtt-config PATH` as an explicit manifest override and
loads and validates that document before constructing scanner hardware. Resolved
password values are never serialized back into configuration; only the
environment-variable name is stored.

See [Daemon MQTT publication](daemon-mqtt.md) for the complete manifest and
topic contracts.

## Python API

The public API exposes immutable values and per-field provenance:

```python
from sds200 import load_application_configuration

resolved = load_application_configuration()
configuration = resolved.configuration

print(configuration.reconnect_policy)
print(resolved.source_for("reconnect_attempts"))
print(resolved.origin_for("log_level"))
```

Use `resolve_configuration_paths()` with injected environment and home values
when applications or tests need deterministic path resolution without touching
the host user's directories.

## Secrets

The version 1 application schema contains no credential-bearing fields. Unknown
fields are reported by name and source, not by value.

Saved remote-audio destinations continue to store environment-variable secret
references rather than resolved passwords. The daemon destination manifest
selects those profiles by name and never stores resolved credentials. The daemon
MQTT manifest follows the same rule: `password_environment_variable` stores only
the environment-variable name, and a password reference requires an MQTT
username. Resolved credentials must not be written to application configuration,
destination configuration, MQTT configuration, logs, exceptions, traces, or
serialized output.

See [Daemon deployment and upgrade guide](daemon-deployment.md) for systemd,
destination-manifest, service-account, migration, and upgrade examples.
